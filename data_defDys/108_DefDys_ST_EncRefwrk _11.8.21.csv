The fields of black theatre criticism and performance studies encompass a heterogeneous array of critical methodologies, theoretical paradigms, and journalistic, literary, and historical writings. This collection therefore brings together a combination of period-specific articles, aesthetic essays, and academic criticism in order to chart the development of a discursive tradition that evolved alongside pathbreaking innovations in black performance culture. Because formal theatre and dramatic productions historically served as central forms of employment, social exchange, and cultural representation for African Americans from the Reconstruction era through the mid-twentieth century, this volume places a particular emphasis on examining critical writing that focuses on drama and theatre. The collection includes essays and articles that explore cultural themes, early goals, and the long-term influences of key players in the field.This introductory essay provides an overview of black theatre and performance studies by contextualizing the development of these fields both chronologically and thematically. For each period, seminal work crucial to understanding the fields of black theatre and performance studies is included. The collection pays special attention to minstrelsy, vernacular folk culture, civil rights activism and cultural history, black nationalism, black feminism, and experimental and avant-garde theatre movements.","2006","2021-11-10 21:53:03","2021-11-10 21:53:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Black Studies Center","2501742225","","","Place: Ann Arbor Publisher: ProQuest","","","https://resolver.ebscohost.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Assbe&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&rft.genre=unknown&rft.jtitle=&rft.atitle=&rft.au=Brooks%2C+Daphne&rft.aulast=Brooks&rft.aufirst=Daphne&rft.date=2006-01-01&rft.volume=&rft.issue=&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=Black+Theatre+and+Performance+Studies%3A+Seminal+Critical+Essays+and+Articles&rft.title=Black+Theatre+and+Performance+Studies%3A+Seminal+Critical+Essays+and+Articles&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/","United States; Race relations; Literary criticism; History; Literary themes; Literary history; Actors; Literary theory; African American history; 20th century; Black feminism; 19th century; Playwrights; African American authors; African American theater; African Theatre Company; Arts—Performing Arts; Baldwin, James; Black Arts Movement; Blackface performance; Childress, Alice; Civil rights movement; Douglass, Frederick; DuBois, W E B; Hansberry, Lorraine; Harlem Renaissance; Hip hop; History—The Americas—USA; Hughes, Langston; Music theater; New York, New York; Performance venues; Performers; Plays; Racial attitudes; Robeson, Paul; Theater companies; Wilson, August","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the foreword, Bowron explains the organization of works into four thematic groupings: the Wild West; the metropolis; social and political critique; and popular culture. The introduction and the essays `Asphaltcowboys and Stadtindianer: imagining the Far West', `Utopia/dystopia: Dada-merica and dollarica' and `Jungle music and song of machines: jazz and American dance in Weimar Culture' are by Beeke Sell Tower. In her epilogue she states that a common ground, a root metaphor for all that epitomizes the U. S. A. is the notion of youth. In his essay Czaplicka analyses the pictorial formulation of the modern urban-industrial Amerikabild in Germany. He notes that the artists of Weimar Germany transformed the clichés of American youth and the themes of popular American culture into a rich imagery of a largely imagery continent.","1990","2021-11-10 21:53:08","2021-11-10 21:53:08","","123","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Arts Premium Collection","1366801242; 0000082517","","","Publisher: [Published by Gallery]","","","https://resolver.ebscohost.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aartbibliographies&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&rft.genre=unknown&rft.jtitle=&rft.atitle=&rft.au=Bowron%2C+Edgar+Peters%3BCzaplicka%2C+John%3BTower%2C+Beeke+Sell&rft.aulast=Bowron&rft.aufirst=Edgar&rft.date=1990-01-01&rft.volume=&rft.issue=&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=0916724735&rft.btitle=Envisioning+America%3A+prints%2C+drawings+and+photographs+by+George+Grosz+and+his+contemporaries%2C+1915-1933&rft.title=Envisioning+America%3A+prints%2C+drawings+and+photographs+by+George+Grosz+and+his+contemporaries%2C+1915-1933&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/","Drawing: Germany; Grosz, George; Photography: Germany; Prints: Germany","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

THE WORKS ARE ARRANGED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS: UTOPIAN DREAMS: ITALIAN FUTURISM; RUSSIAN AVANT-GARDE; GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM; GERMAN BAUHAUS; DUTCH DE STIJL; FRENCH PURISM AND LEGER; AMERICAN PRECISIONISM AND ARCHITECTURE; POST-WORLD WAR II; AND 'DYSTOPIAN NIGHTMARES': EARLY PREMONITIONS; AND POST-WORLD WAR II. THE ESSAY FOLLOWS THE SAME CATEGORIES, NOTING THE FEELING OF EXPECTATION OF A NEW AGE THAT PERVADED EUROPE IN THE LATE 19TH AND EARLY 20TH CENTURIES, AND TRACING THE HISTORY OF THE CONCEPT OF UTOPIA FROM SIR THOMAS MORE ONWARDS. THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT THE FIRST WORLD WAR ACTED AS A CATALYST FOR THIS FEELING, AND THAT IT WAS EXPRESSED IN ALL THE MAJOR 20TH CENTURY ART MOVEMENTS.","1983","2021-11-10 21:53:08","2021-11-10 21:53:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Arts Premium Collection","1426997886; 0000023596","","","","","","https://resolver.ebscohost.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aartbibliographies&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&rft.genre=unknown&rft.jtitle=&rft.atitle=&rft.au=&rft.aulast=&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=1983-01-01&rft.volume=&rft.issue=&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=DREAMS+AND+NIGHTMARES%3A+UTOPIAN+VISIONS+IN+MODERN+ART&rft.title=DREAMS+AND+NIGHTMARES%3A+UTOPIAN+VISIONS+IN+MODERN+ART&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/","BAUHAUS; ARCHITECTURE, U.S.A.; ART, 20TH CENTURY; EXPRESSIONISM; ICONOGRAPHY, UTOPIA; LEGER, FERNAND; PRECISIONISM; STIJL, DE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using science fiction themes along with special techniques, a teacher can involve students in examining values, setting goals, and speculating about the future. The guide includes subject area possibilities for science fiction; tips for the use of multi-titles and small groups in a science fiction unit; a sample classroom valuing exercise; tips for writing behavioral objectives; specific science fiction themes and related books; a speculation exercise designed to develop creative thinking; five thematic teaching units on the subjects of utopia/dystopia, extraterrestrial invasion, present invasion and contact by UFOs, future invasions, and humanity versus technology; evaluation methods and questions for a course or unit; and techniques for using science fiction to introduce or conclude a conventional unit on literature, social studies, or humanities.
