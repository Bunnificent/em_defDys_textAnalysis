"16. Fiction, 1980-1992 (Part I: History)","Here is the standard line: in the early 1980s sf was drifting in the doldrums and nothing much new was happening. The dinosaurs and traditionalists were receiving Hugos and Nebulas for work that was often culturally passé and nowhere near their best, with multiple nominations for writers Arthur C. Clarke (The Fountains of Paradise (1979), 2010: Odyssey Two (1982)), Frederik Pohl (JEM: the making of a utopia (1979), Beyond the Blue Event Horizon (1980), “Fermi and Frost” (1985)), Isaac Asimov (Foundation's Edge (1982), The Robots of Dawn (1983)), Robert A. Heinlein (Friday (1982)), Clifford Simak (“Grotto of the Dancing Deer” (1980), Project Pope (1981)), Gordon Dickson (“Lost Dorsai” (1980), “The Cloak and the Staff” (1980)), Larry Niven (Ringworld Engineers (1979)), and Anne McCaffrey (Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern (1983)).

And then came the cyberpunks - William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, and the lesser lights who moved in their orbit. Gibson's Neuromancer (1984) took the Hugo and Nebula, defeating Heinlein and Niven, and the sf world was changed forever. That is the story and everyone who thinks that they are familiar with the history of sf knows it.

Well, maybe.

The cyberpunks were indeed the biggest thing to hit sf since the New Wave, and they did change the field significantly. Within a very few years, even though Gibson and Sterling were declaring the Movement dead, many of their favorite tropes - the disaffected, inevitably cool computer cowboy hero; the brain-modifying wetware and input jacks; the polluted future dominated by evil corporations - had become the standard coin of the genre, used even by veterans like Pohl and Poul Anderson, who had their roots in the 1940s. It is worth noting, however, that, although some of the veterans may have received award nominations largely on the strength of reputation (particularly Heinlein and Asimov), others (notably Clarke and Pohl) were in fact still writing at the top of their form, producing fiction that was indeed worthy of nomination. It is also worth taking note of the other nominees in those years. Some of them were traditionalists, who wrote extremely good traditional sf. Others, although not cyberpunks, were nonetheless experimenting in significant and useful ways.

For example, 1980 alone saw the publication of three particularly memorable novels, each of which may still be rated its author's finest work: Joan D. Vinge's Hugo-winning The Snow Queen, Gene Wolfe's The Shadow of the Torturer, and Gregory Benford's Nebula-winning Timescape. The Snow Queen, which borrows from both Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale and Robert Graves's The White Goddess (1947), tells a morally complex and beautifully written tale of lost love and political machinations set against a well-conceived alien landscape with distinct fantasy undertones. Comparable in both quality and feel to Frank Herbert's Dune (1965), it too was followed by a series of less memorable sequels. Gene Wolfe's The Shadow of the Torturer is also the opening salvo in what eventually grew to be a multi-volume megatext, although Wolfe somehow managed to make each title in the series noteworthy. Moving into territory previously explored by William Hope Hodgson's The Night Land (1912) and Jack Vance's The Dying Earth (1950), Torturer takes place in the unimaginably distant future, a time so remote from ours that our own far future has become the novel's prehistoric past. Set on an exhausted world whose sun is dying, it concerns Severian, a disgraced professional torturer who embarks on a religious pilgrimage of sorts. The novel's language is baroque, as is its multilayered, intensely allegorical plot, and like The Snow Queen it often feels closer to fantasy than sf. Severian's story continues in three further volumes (1981-3) of The Book of the New Sun, with The Urth of the New Sun (1987) clearing up loose ends. Two further sequences of novels, The Book of the Long Sun (1993-6) and The Book of the Short Sun (1999-2001), continue Wolfe's story, each from a radically different perspective. Taken as a whole, the series clearly qualifies as one of the masterpieces of genre fiction.

As Helen Merrick notes in her chapter above, a common fear among many long-term sf readers at this time was that, possibly due to the increased presence of women writers in the field (although Tolkien's success was arguably a bigger influence), true sf was being diluted by the work of writers who, like Vinge and Wolfe, were comfortable using fantasy tropes. However, physicist Gregory Benford, who famously defined writing hard sf as “playing with the net up” (Benford 1994: 16), produced a clear counterbalance to this tendency with Timescape, which is often considered to be the most accurate genre portrayal ever published of how real science is done. Set in a badly polluted and near-collapse 1998, it concerns a desperate attempt by scientists to use tachyons to send a warning message about the fate of the world to their counterparts in 1962. Avoiding much in the way of sf's usual pyrotechnics and sleight of hand, Benford nonetheless created a riveting tale of suspense that is simultaneously a serious exploration of the paradoxes involved in any attempt to communicate or travel through time.

Regardless of avant-garde movements such as the New Wave and cyberpunk, sf's bread-and-butter has largely always been tales of wondrous adventure set in outer space. Whether called space opera, space fiction, or planetary romance, the early 1980s produced several superior examples, with John Varley, David Brin, and C.J. Cherryh arguably the most talented authors involved. All three worked within future histories of their own creation. Varley's Gaea trilogy (Titan (1979), Wizard (1980), Demon (1984)), which has been praised for its innovative exploration of gender and sexuality, takes place within the body of an intelligent, planetary-sized alien being, Gaea, who has constructed a series of habitats, peopled by quirky, artificially constructed intelligent species, essentially for its own enjoyment. Brin's Uplift series, starting with Sundiver (1980), came to prominence with the Hugo- and Nebula-winning Startide Rising (1983) and Hugo-winning The Uplift War (1987). It sends humanity (accompanied by uplifted dolphins and chimps) out into a complex universe peopled by hundreds of not particularly friendly alien species, many of them enormously more ancient and intelligent than ourselves. (Three more volumes followed in the 1990s.) The prolific C.J. Cherryh's complex Alliance-Union Universe, with its many subseries, includes the Hugo-winning Downbelow Station (1981) and Cyteen (1988). Perhaps the finest creator of realistic, lived-in futures in outer space to grace the genre, Cherryh centers her stories on the men and women who actually run the space stations and haul cargo between star systems. Her dramatic, often painful novels feature complex characters and believable environments. All three writers also produced outstanding short fiction, with Varley doing his best shorter work of the period in “Beatnik Bayou” (1980), “The Pusher” (1981), and “Press Enter” (1984).

The early 1980s also saw the publication of a number of odd and wonderful novels that do not fit into easy categories. Future Nobel Prize-winner Doris Lessing produced the extraordinary but very difficult Canopus in Argos series (1979-83). Alasdair Gray's Lanark: a life in 4 books (1981) combines intensely realistic, autobiographical sections in contemporary Glasgow with surreal chapters located in the futuristic city of Unthank to create a powerful work of dystopian fiction widely considered to be one of the most important modern Scottish novels. Christopher Priest's dream-like The Affirmation (1981) also moves back and forth between the contemporary world and a strange alternate universe. Brian Aldiss's Helliconia trilogy (1982-5) is a superb example of large-scale world building which chronicles one “great year” in the life of a planet whose eccentric orbit takes hundreds of Earth years to complete, allowing the author space for a wide-ranging, satirical, but at the same time deadly serious, critique of Western culture. The protagonist of Michael Bishop's Nebula-winning tale of time travel and evolution, No Enemy But Time (1982), appears to have true dreams about our Pleistocene ancestors. Norman Spinrad's The Void Captain's Tale (1983) uses Freudian psychology, explicit sexual content, and witty prose to reexamine many of the basic tropes of sf. These and other fine and original works may not always have won the major awards, but they demonstrate that, contrary to the simplistic standardline, many exciting and innovative sf novels appeared in the early 1980s.

But then came cyberpunk. It was, of course, never the complete break from earlier sf that it claimed to be, with clear roots in the work of Alfred Bester, Samuel Delany, Philip K. Dick, and others. Bruce Bethke, not generally considered a cyberpunk, invented the term for the title of a 1980 short story, but the label was popularized by Gardner Dozois, the editor of Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine (1977-), to describe the work of writers like Sterling, Gibson, and Lewis Shiner. In the early 1980s, Sterling, who had been publishing since the mid-1970s, used the pseudonym Vincent Omniaveritas in his newsletter Cheap Truth to push the fiction he valued and rant against what he saw as the complacency of most contemporary sf, singling out older writers like Heinlein but also such well-regarded contemporaries as Brin, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Michael Swanwick for withering and largely undeserved scorn. Although as Omniaveritas he claimed to be skeptical of the various labels - including “punk,” “the Movement,” “neuromantic,” and “cyberpunk” - that were being applied to the fiction he favored, Sterling nonetheless realized their value as a marketing ploy and, with tongue firmly planted in cheek, pushed cyberpunk as the next big thing in sf. This culminated in his landmark Mirrorshades: a cyberpunk anthology (1986), which featured superb fiction by not only the writers normally associated with the Movement, but also Greg Bear, James Patrick Kelly, and others. From there, of course, cyberpunk took off as a cultural meme employed by a variety of technophilic groups having little or no direct connection to the literary movement itself. By then, however, Sterling and company had already (prematurely, it turned out) proclaimed cyberpunk dead.

Key cyberpunk texts include: Sterling's Shaper/Mechanist stories (including “Swarm” (1982) and culminating in Schismatrix (1985), which combined ideas about cyber- and biologically-induced posthumanity with well-done space opera), his theoretically post-cyberpunk Islands in the Net (1988), and stories collected in Crystal Express (1989); Rudy Rucker's Software (1982), and its sequels, which explore the possibility of sloughing off this mortal coil and depositing our minds in software; Lewis Shiner's Frontera (1984), which concerns the grim fate of an abandoned NASA colony on Mars; John Shirley's influential proto-cyberpunk City Come A-Walkin' (1980) as well as Eclipse (1985), and its sequels, in which punks and rockers lead a revolt against the right-wing domination of the West; and various short stories by Pat Cadigan, such as “Rock On” (1984) and “Pretty Boy Crossover” (1986), eventually collected in Patterns (1989). Two other texts deserving mention here are Vernor Vinge's “True Names” (1981) and Greg Bear's “Blood Music” (1983; novel, 1985). Although not formally a cyberpunk story, Vinge's novella was one of the first pieces of fiction to explore the concept of what eventually came to be known as “cyberspace.” Bear was as fascinated as Sterling with the possibilities inherent in the posthuman body. In “Blood Music,” in which a scientist creates intelligent microorganisms that eventually transform him into something more than human, he almost single-handedly jumpstarted sf's ongoing love affair with nanotechnology.

The most important work of cyberpunk fiction, however, and one of most influential sf novels ever written, was Gibson's Neuromancer. Gibson's apprenticeship as a short-story writer produced such startlingly polished pieces as “The Gernsback Continuum” (1981) and “Johnny Mnemonic” (1981) (both collected in Burning Chrome (1986)), but Neuromancer was an instant wake-up call to the sf community. It has its flaws - the plot is at times a tad incoherent, the language occasionally overwrought, and Gibson's debts to Bester, William Burroughs, Raymond Chandler, and others has been widely analyzed - but its importance was instantly recognized. It remains the only novel ever to win the Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K. Dick awards. This dark, intensely metaphoric caper-tale of psychologically tortured and surgically altered computer hackers and street samurai working a dangerous heist for an unknown employer, set in a corrupt, garbage-filled and intensely urban near future, where soulless mega-corporations and enigmatic Artificial Intelligences run everything, became a new template for the field. Its immediate sequels, Count Zero (1986) and Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988), although perforce less startlingly original, were even more polished in their prose style and plotting. Gibson's later novels, beginning with Virtual Light (1993), fall outside the purview of this chapter, but represent (Sterling's proclamation of the death of cyberpunk not withstanding) a continuing refinement of his techniques and methods.

Michael Swanwick's controversial “A User's Guide to the Postmoderns” (1986), written partly in reply to Sterling's carryings-on in his fanzine Cheap Truth and which he later claimed was taken more seriously than he intended, argued that the most important contemporary (or “postmodern”) sf writers neatly divided into two groups - the cyberpunks, consisting primarily of writers discussed above, and the humanists, including Connie Willis, Kim Stanley Robinson, John Kessel, and James Patrick Kelly (Swanwick later added Lucius Shepard and Nancy Kress to the humanist camp). Another writer Swanwick failed to mention, but who definitely belonged among the humanists, was Octavia E. Butler. Conveniently, Swanwick had a foot in both camps, having co-authored the cyberpunk “Dogfight” (1985) with Gibson, as well as writing the more obviously humanist In the Drift (1984). Indeed, his early career was marked by repeated movement back and forth across the divide, following the cyberpunk Vacuum Flowers (1987) with the Nebula-winning Stations of the Tide (1991), which feels much closer to Aldiss's Helliconia novels than anything by Sterling or Gibson.

But what exactly was “humanist” sf? Swanwick defined it as “literate, often consciously literary fiction, focusing on human characters who are generally seen as frail and fallible, using the genre to explore large philosophical questions, sometimes religious in nature” (Swanwick 1986: 7). It should be immediately obvious to any reader of the sf of this period that virtually all of these characteristics can also be found in cyberpunk (Gibson is among the most self-consciously literary writers in the field and Sterling is often philosophical). Still, it is clear that, despite the satiric overstatement (he describes Robinson as a gunslinger and compares Gibson to Elvis Costello), Swanwick had a point. In a transformation somewhat more subtle than that worked by the cyberpunks but equally important, sf was being remade in the fiction of Willis (“Firewatch” (1982), “The Last of the Winnebagos” (1988), “At the Realto” (1989)), Robinson (“Black Air” (1983), The Blind Geometer (1986)), Kessel (“Another Orphan” (1982)), Kelly (“Rat” (1986)), Kress (“Out of All Them Bright Stars” (1985), Beggars in Spain (1991)), Butler (“Speech Sounds” (1983), “Bloodchild” (1984)), Shepard (“Salvador” (1984), “R&R” (1986)), and Swanwick himself (“Mummer Kiss” (1981), “The Edge of the World” (1989)). The so-called humanists did not issue manifestos or shout from the rooftops about the differences between their work and earlier sf, but their short stories regularly achieved a level of literary quality previously reached by a very limited number of genre writers. They also produced superb fiction at novel length. Of particular note are Robinson's quietly understated post-apocalyptic The Wild Shore (1984), which was widely seen as standing in direct contrast to Gibson's more pyrotechnic Neuromancer, and Shepard's sf zombie novel Green Eyes, which three volumes, along with Swanwick's Into the Drift, constituted the spectacular 1984 relaunch of the much-praised Ace Specials series of uniformly packaged paperback originals. Other fine novels by the humanists include Robinson's The Memory of Whiteness (1985) and The Gold Coast (1988), Willis's Lincoln's Dreams (1987) and Doomsday Book (1992), Kessel's Good News from Outer Space (1989), Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy (1987-9), and Shepard's Life During Wartime (1987). Of course, a number of writers who might easily have fallen under the humanist umbrella, but who had begun publication rather earlier, were still producing quality work in the 1980s, such as James Tiptree Jr's “The Only Neat Thing to Do” (1985) and Brightness Falls from the Air (1985), Roger Zelazny's “Unicorn Variation” (1981) and “Permafrost” (1986), Ursula K. Le Guin's “Sur” (1982), George R.R. Martin's “Nightflyers” (1980) and “One-Wing” (1980; with Lisa Tuttle), and any number of short stories by Harlan Ellison.

Another important writer who stands apart from the cyberpunks and the humanists, but who shares with the former a talent for controversy and with the latter an interest in religious issues, is Orson Scott Card, whose Hugo- and Nebula-winning Ender's Game (1985) became one of the bestselling sf novels of all time. Ender's Game tells the story of a military genius who, while still a child, is manipulated into exterminating what is believed to be a hostile alien species. At the end of the novel, however, it is discovered that the whole war was a tragic misunderstanding. In the first sequel, Speaker for the Dead (1986), which also won the Hugo and the Nebula, a grown-up Ender is shown, Christ-like, devoting his life to atonement for his crime. The controversy surrounding Ender's Game and Card's subsequent work stems from his willingness to espouse controversial political and social opinions, and the generally implicit use in his fiction of his Mormon beliefs. Together these practices made Card the field's foremost lightning rod as well as a major writer.

Between 1980 and 1992, no single political event polarized the field in the way the Vietnam War had in the 1970s, although the aftershocks from that international debacle continued to be felt in the fiction of, among others, David Drake, whose Hammers Slammers series of military sf (1979-), appeared to stem from a sincere belief that the US armed forces had been betrayed by the American government itself. Shepard's Life During Wartime, Geoff Ryman's The Unconquered Country (1986), and Bruce McAllister's Dream Baby (1989) considered the war from a leftist perspective. Reactions to the Reagan/Thatcher era's lessening of liberal social expectations and increased empowerment of large corporations were also common on both sides of the political spectrum. The cyberpunks, of course, were partially writing in response to the increasingly conservative times in which they found themselves, and Gwyneth Jones's Divine Endurance (1984), although set in the far future, is chock-full of veiled leftist political commentary. The libertarian right, a consistent element in sf, found its strongest voice during the 1980s in the work of Niven (Oath of Fealty (1981), with Jerry Pournelle, and Fallen Angels (1991), with Pournelle and Michael Flynn). Robinson's work had a powerful leftist perspective in Pacific Edge (1990) and the Nebula-winning Red Mars (1992), the first volume of his Mars trilogy, with its visions of ecologically sound leftist utopias. More pessimistic, George Turner, in the powerful but depressing The Sea and Summer (1987), portrayed a dying, overpopulated future Australia lacking the political will to do anything to improve its state. Another powerful warning about global warming and ecological catastrophe was Brin's Earth (1990). Ian McDonald's Hearts, Hands and Voices (1992) presents a beautiful but heartbreaking allegory for the troubles, both political and religious, in contemporary Ireland.

Joanna Russ had largely fallen silent by the 1980s, except for the fine “Souls” (1982) and “The Little Dirty Girl” (1982), and Suzy McKee Charnas had mostly turned to young adult fiction, except for her memorable werewolf tale “Boobs” (1989), but significant feminist sf did appear throughout this period. Suzette Haden Elgin's Native Tongue (1984), and its sequels, present an angry dystopia in which women, having lost most of their rights, create a secret language to aid in their attempt to undermine patriarchy. Le Guin's magnificent experiment in speculative anthropology, Always Coming Home (1985), postulates the development of the Kesh, a post-patriarchal society in a post-industrial future California. More influential, and among the most talked about speculative novels of the period, was Margaret Atwood's ferocious The Handmaid's Tale (1985), which envisions a genuinely sick, fundamentalist patriarchy in which women are little more than slaves, prized only for their ability to conceive. In Joan Slonczewski's novel of pacifism and deep-ecology, A Door into Ocean (1986), the all-female society of the planet Shora deals successfully with an invasion by an intensely patriarchal and militaristic culture. Josephine Saxton's Queen of the States (1986) concerns a woman who may be mad or who may be the subject of an alien interrogation. In Sheri S. Tepper's angry, post-nuclear holocaust The Gate to Women's Country (1988), modeled in part on Aristophanes' Lysistrata, women have taken control of society and fool the men into leading useless lives devoted to game-playing and carefully controlled military skirmishes. Jones's White Queen (1991), and its sequels, presented an unusually sophisticated analysis of gender roles, portraying the difficult interactions between humanity and an alien race whose concept of gender differs considerably from our own. Pamela Sargent's The Shore of Women (1986), Eleanor Arnason's A Woman of the Iron People (1991), and Nicola Griffith's Ammonite (1993) also successfully examine the implications of gender-segregated societies. During the 1980s, men also began to write seriously on gender issues. Varley has already been mentioned. Delany's difficult but rewarding Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand (1984) explored the topics of desire and personal freedom with great moral seriousness and, along with Ryman's The Child Garden (1988) and Maureen McHugh's China Mountain Zhang (1992), dealt with homosexuality with significant intelligence.

The mid-1980s was a time for manifestos. Getting the jump on both Sterling and Swanwick were David Pringle and Colin Greenland, whose editorial in the spring 1984 issue of the British magazine Interzone called for a new radical hard sf that would, unlike the inward-turning New Wave, take on not just politics but also cutting-edge science. In the mid- to late 1980s, Interzone published a wide range of outstanding fiction by veterans such as M. John Harrison, Thomas Disch, and Ian Watson, and talented new authors, such as Ryman, Griffith, Kim Newman, and Mary Gentle (and Sterling and Gibson). It also published a number of writers who specifically came to be associated with radical hard sf, including Paul J. McAuley, Stephen Baxter, Charles Stross, and Australian Greg Egan, each of whom went on to write important hard-sf novels, including McAuley's Four Hundred Billion Stars (1988) and Eternal Light (1991), Baxter's Raft (1991) and Timelike Infinity (1992), Stross's Accelerando (2005), and Egan's Quarantine (1992).

Throughout its history, people have repeatedly proclaimed the death of sf or insisted that changes in the publishing industry were making it harder and harder for genuinely good work to find an outlet. Nonetheless fine novels and short stories continue to appear, with the late 1980s and early 1990s a particularly fertile period. Two particular trends stand out: “second-generation” cyberpunk and the “new space opera.”

Of course, trying to decide which authors are first- and which are second-generation cyberpunks (or post-cyberpunks) is largely a waste of time, in part because some of the original cyberpunks never really stopped writing the stuff, and in part because so many people tried it once or twice in careers devoted primarily to other sorts of fiction. Cadigan, whose contributions to the movement during its supposed heyday were limited to well-crafted short stories, went on to produce (and is in fact still writing) significant cyberpunk novels, including Synners (1991) and Fools (1992). Other successful continuations of the subgenre include Walter Jon Williams's Hardwired (1986), Spinrad's Little Heroes (1987), George Alec Effinger's When Gravity Fails (1987) and its sequels, Newman's The Night Mayor (1989), and even literary novelist Marge Piercy's He, She, and It (1991). Cyberpunk-influenced fiction continues to appear (by authors like Richard K. Morgan and Jon Courtney Grimwood) but the most important latter-day descendant of Sterling and Gibson is undoubtedly Neal Stephenson, author of Snow Crash (1992) and The Diamond Age (1995). The former, which probably caused a bigger stir than any cyberpunk work since Neuromancer, featured a hero who is simultaneously a talented hacker, a would-be samurai, and a pizza-delivery man. A dazzling display of literary pyrotechnics, linguistic theory, and razor-sharp satire, it recounts the hero's attempts to save virtual reality from a deadly computer virus.

Like cyberpunk, the so-called “new space opera” has roots in earlier fiction. At one time, the very term “space opera” was widely used in a derogatory sense, referring to spectacular but generally dated and often poorly written tales of outer space derring-do, such as Edward Hamilton's “Crashing Suns” (1928) or E.E. Smith and Lee H. Garby's The Skylark of Space (1928). Such stories were often contrasted, to their detriment, with the more sophisticated space fiction of Heinlein, Asimov, and Clarke published in Campbell's Astounding in the years immediately following the Second World War. Indeed as late as the 1980s, when Varley, Brin, and Cherryh were doing their best early work, novels like Titan, Startide Rising, and Downbelow Station would never have been referred to as space opera. Still, the similarities are there - spaceships and spectacle, aliens and adventure, marvelous planetary landscapes and mind-blowing astronomical phenomena - but written about with better prose, more believable characters, and fewer obvious violations of scientific laws. Indeed many of the finest sf novels of the late 1980s and early 1990s were space fiction and may be seen as direct descendants of Hamilton and Smith. Among the better works of modern space opera by American writers are Lois McMaster Bujold's Miles Vorkosigan novels, beginning with Shards of Honor (1986); the military space opera of David Drake, including Ranks of Bronze (1986); and Benford's Galactic Center novels, most notably Great Sky River (1987). Of particular interest are Dan Simmons's Hugo-winning Hyperion (1989), along with its sequels, beginning with The Fall of Hyperion (1990), which used The Canterbury Tales (c. 1387) and the poetry of John Keats as structuring devices to tell a complex story of political intrigue set in a far-future interstellar civilization; and Vernor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep (1992), also a Hugo-winner, which related a thrilling interplanetary rescue set against a galaxy filled with exotic alien species where new discoveries in physics have placed strict limits on human intellectual evolution.

The phrase “new space opera,” however, has a specifically British provenance. In the 1970s, the New Wave in large part became synonymous, at least in the minds of critics, with British sf, despite the ongoing publication of space fiction by such writers as Brian Stableford and Harrison, whose The Centauri Device (1974), although written in opposition to traditional American space opera, is often cited by later British writers as a particular influence. Such generally minor works continued to be published into the 1980s without much fanfare until the appearance of a writer whom the critics genuinely could not ignore: Iain M. Banks. Already a major literary figure as Iain Banks, author of The Wasp Factory (1984) and other experimental novels, he used his middle initial to differentiate the startlingly well-done and totally unrepentant space operas that he had actually begun writing (but not publishing) in the late 1970s from his more mainstream work. The first to see print, Consider Phlebas (1987), introduced the Culture, a sophisticated and liberal interstellar society which had taken as its duty the reformation of other, more benighted civilizations. Although Banks often portrayed the Culture as owning the moral high ground, particularly in the earlier novels, similarities between his fictional society and the contemporary West were not coincidental and later additions to the series became increasingly cynical. Other notable Culture novels include The Player of Games (1988) and Use of Weapons (1990). As popularized by Banks, the new space opera featured high literary standards, significant political commentary, particularly from a left-wing perspective, along with a willingness to accept moral ambiguity rarely found in the work of American authors (except, perhaps, Simmons) in this subgenre. As influential as Banks, however, was Greenland, who had earlier written the standard scholarly work on the New Wave, The Entropy Exhibition (1983), and whose Interzone editorial jumpstarted British radical hard sf. His Take Back Plenty (1990), and sequels, with its postmodern satire, sexually liberated heroine, and leftist politics, was something of a revelation to other British authors and is frequently cited as a model for the new space opera by later writers such as Peter F. Hamilton, Ken MacLeod, and Alastair Reynolds.

By 1992, the field of sf looked significantly different from the way it had in 1980. Cyberpunk's once radical motifs had become common coin, the so-called humanists had helped raise literary expectations, and new British writers were taking their turn at transforming the genre. Authors as diverse as Gray, Wolfe, Gibson, Le Guin, Robinson, and Banks had produced a wide range of superb fiction, although old-fashioned work not all that noticeably different from the pulps was still seeing print and finding an audience. As always, new dinosaurs and a new avant-garde were already in the making.",,2137949288,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Levy, Michael"," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

18. Fiction Since 1992 (Part I: History),"If we recognize sf as a literature forged in the rationalist revolution of the Renaissance and tempered in the secularist revolution of the Enlightenment, then the years after 1992 have seen the literature under more stress than at any time in its history. As religion becomes a major issue in world (as opposed to local) conflict for the first time since the seventeenth century and a potent force in the local politics of even such supposedly secularist states as Britain and the US, as global terrorism brings anxiety into every moment of daily life, and as environmental struggles gather pace, a literature espousing rationalism and secularism seems more and more out of step with the world. Increasingly, overtly sf works have incorporated gods, angels, or the supernatural. For example, in The Forever War (1974), Joe Haldeman, one of the most consistent sf writers of the period, wrote a rational and secular response to the Vietnam War, but in the sequel, Forever Free (1999), he brought God on stage to effect its climax. Jay Lake's Mainspring (2007) presents a mechanistic universe in which God plays a direct and unquestioned role, and even John Clute's Appleseed (2001), which describes a war against god, implicitly recognizes the role of God in the universe. Among the works of newer writers, M. Rickert being a prime but far from lonely example, angels proliferate. This chapter will look at how sf has responded to this change in context in three ways, by turning backwards, by becoming a literature of the irrational, or by trying to become a mundane literature.

This is not the whole story, of course. Much, possibly most, sf published during the period has continued regardless along its familiar furrow. The most popular writer of the 1990s, for instance, at least if judged by her stranglehold on popular-vote awards such as the Hugos, was Lois McMaster Bujold. Her long series of novels, with a militaristic background reminiscent of C.S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian, and a romantic plot that owed much to Georgette Heyer, spawned a whole string of copycat series, notably including works by David Feintuch, David Weber, and Elizabeth Moon. Although it may be comforting in a time of anxiety, this is increasingly the sf that is seen as tired, dated, and uninteresting.

A sign of the growing uncertainty about the role, nature, and future of the genre has been the plethora of movements within it. With the possible exception of the New Wave in the 1960s and cyberpunk in the 1980s, sf had not really gone in for movements before the 1990s, but all at once we were treated to New Hard sf, New Space Opera, New Wave Fabulism, New Weird, Interstitial Arts, Mundane Sf, and so forth, complete with editorials, special issues, and even the occasional manifesto. Some of these were alternative names for the same thing, some overlapped to a considerable extent, some - though by no means all - were meant ironically. The use of “New” in so many of the titles seems to mark an insistence on the novelty of such movements, even though much of what was gathered into their folds was in reality a revival or reworking of older models.

Few if any of these movements have had anything other than a local and temporary impact. One that did, and whose influence extended over the entire period under discussion, was the so-called “British Renaissance.” But the extent and character of this revitalization of British sf became evident only around the turn of the century. During the 1990s there was nothing to suggest that American sf would not remain the dominant force in the genre as it had for most of the twentieth century. Gene Wolfe, who had revitalized American sf in the 1980s with his extraordinary tetralogy The Book of the New Sun (1980-3), now followed it with another tetralogy, The Book of the Long Sun (1993-6) and a trilogy, The Book of the Short Sun (1999-2001), both set in the same universe as, but predating, the original sequence. However, although any new work by Wolfe is an event, these later novels, while building into an ever more complex vision of the world, did not have quite the same impact upon the genre. Nevertheless, the period did open with one work of American sf that was at least as ambitious and influential as Wolfe's Book of the New Sun had been. Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy (Red Mars (1992), Green Mars (1993), Blue Mars (1996)) tells in great detail, over 200 years and 1,600 pages, the story of the terraforming of Mars and the human consequence for the colonists. It was a benchmark for realist, scientifically, and politically literate sf (and Robinson's color-coded trilogy would be followed by White Mars (1999) by Brian Aldiss with Roger Penrose, and Larry Niven's Rainbow Mars (1999), the latter owing far more to Edgar Rice Burroughs's Barsoom). But by the end of the trilogy Robinson was giving more and more space to long, evenhanded political debates between characters, a trait that continued in subsequent novels, The Years of Rice and Salt (2002), an alternate history which imagined a Europe depopulated by the Black Death, and the Science in the Capital trilogy (Forty Signs of Rain (2004), Fifty Degrees Below (2005), Sixty Days and Counting (2007)), which examines global warming. These debates have tended to blunt the dramatic edge of his fiction.

Only Neal Stephenson has since attempted anything that approaches the scale or the ambition of the Mars trilogy. Of that great artificial dichotomy in late 1980s American sf between cyberpunks and humanists, Robinson was the leading humanist and the Mars trilogy its preeminent statement. Stephenson found himself acclaimed as one of the leading cyberpunks with his breakthrough novel, Snow Crash (1992), a bravura description of a world in which a computer virus begins to have a profound effect upon human reality. His Cryptonomicon (1999) marked a move to integrate a cyberpunk aesthetic with the historical novel, counterpointing the story of the wartime origins of computing with a near-future story of the development of an information economy. His Baroque cycle (Quicksilver (2003), The Confusion (2004), The System of the World (2004)), a sort of prequel to Cryptonomicon, explored the origins of a modern economy in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, although its relationship with sf is more in the deployment of ideas and in the sensibility displayed than in any recognizable science-fictional devices or tropes. (It is interesting to compare this with a major work of fantasy from the period, John Crowley's Aegypt sequence (1987-2007), which examines another historical change in the nature of human knowledge, one which the author identifies as occurring at the end of the sixteenth century.)

The clearest statement of the cyberpunk position in the 1990s came in Pat Cadigan's Synners (1991) and Fools (1992), eloquent and ultimately humane accounts of the struggle to hold on to individual identity in an increasingly digitalized world. Of the previous decade's other leading cyberpunks, Bruce Sterling also produced impressive works, although his cyberpunk background was more obvious in his short fiction (e.g., “Bicycle Repairman” (1996)) than novels such as Distraction (1999), a satirical tale of political functionaries in a Balkanized near-future America. William Gibson, on the other hand, did not just leave cyberpunk behind but in Pattern Recognition (2003) and Spook Country (2007) produced novels in which sf is becoming integrated with mainstream fiction about the present day.

Cyberpunk was giving way to what might be seen as its natural successor, a fiction of posthumanity in which identity and often environment are uploaded into advanced computer systems. Cadigan's struggle can be said to have been lost in the work of such post-cyberpunks as Cory Doctorow (Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom (2003)), Charles Stross (Accelerando (2005)) and Greg Egan (Permutation City (1994), Diaspora (1997)). These fictions, representative of a powerful and imaginative new strain that began to appear in the late 1990s, are also indicative of a new irrationalism. The scenario allows for transformations of character or universe at a moment's notice and with little or no real-world consequence; the most fanciful bodies or environments can be tried and discarded at will, and death is no longer permanent. The flights of fancy can be breathtaking, but there is little need for the story or anything contained within it to take a rational course.

Away from such movements, as the end of the millennium approached, a number of American writers continued to produce reliably solid and inventive sf. Significant and very diverse works came in particular from Maureen McHugh (China Mountain Zhang (1992)), Kathleen Ann Goonan (Queen City Jazz (1994)), and perhaps most notably Octavia E. Butler (Parable of the Sower (1993), Parable of the Talents (1998)), whose blending of ideas of race, slavery, and surrender of self can make for uncomfortable reading. If feminist sf was less prominent than in the previous decade, there were still plenty of writers providing significant explorations of feminist ideas. Among the most notable were Sheri Tepper, with Gibbon's Decline and Fall (1996) and The Family Tree (1997), although subsequent novels have tended to be more successful as polemic than as fiction, a complaint also leveled, for instance, at Doris Lessing's The Cleft (2007). In contrast, recent work by Ursula Le Guin, especially Four Ways to Forgiveness (1995) and The Birthday of the World (2002), subsumed polemic under a fiction that is as powerful and affecting as any she has written in a long time.

The main tide of genre sf during this period, however, was the revived interest in hard sf and space opera, perhaps spurred by the monumental retrospective anthologies edited by David Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer (The Ascent of Wonder (1994), The Hard SF Renaissance (2002), The Space Opera Renaissance (2006)). Writers who have consistently worked within these areas such as David Brin (Kiln People (2002)), Gregory Benford (Sailing Bright Eternity (1995), which concluded his impressive Galactic Center sequence (1976-95), and Cosm (1998)), Nancy Kress (Probability Moon (2000), Probability Sun (2001)), and C.J. Cherryh (Finity's End (1997)), continued to produce highly regarded work. The most significant contributions to hard sf and space opera, however, probably came from Vernor Vinge and Greg Bear. Vinge began the 1990s with one of the most innovative space operas of the period, A Fire upon the Deep (1992), which along with A Deepness in the Sky (1999) imagined the effects of a hierarchy of access to space travel across a range of vividly imagined cultures. But a far from prolific writer, he published little else in this period. Bear, also at home in the panoramic sweep of space opera, was perhaps at his best in the cyberpunkish Slant (1997), a sequel to Queen of Angels (1990), although since then he has tended to move toward the sf-inspired thriller. Curiously both Vinge and Bear published Collected Stories (both 2002), and the period saw similar volumes by Arthur C. Clarke and J.G. Ballard (both 2001), 11 volumes of an as-yet incomplete Complete Short Stories of Theodore Sturgeon (1994-), and several attempts to start collecting Robert Silverberg's short fiction. Although Bear and Vinge are both still active short-story writers, there is a sense that this trend is concerned with tying off loose ends, of bringing something to an end. Or perhaps, along with the monumental Hartwell and Cramer anthologies and the profusion of “best of the year” collections (in 2006, there were at least 10; in 2007, this number increased), it says something about the commodification and collectability of sf.

The most distinctive voice in 1990s sf was probably Greg Egan's. His fiction, often emotionally cold but intellectually challenging, made him one of the most acclaimed sf writers to come out of Australia. Indeed, for a while it seemed as if Egan was the harbinger of a new wave in Australian sf. Although none would follow Egan closely in style or subject matter, a generation of writers did find themselves being published more widely and to greater international acclaim than had usually been the lot of their compatriots. Younger writers such as Sean McMullen (Souls in the Great Machine (1999)), Shane Dix and Sean Williams (the Evergence trilogy (1999-2001)), alongside more established names like Terry Dowling (Blue Tyson (1992), Twilight Beach (1993)), mostly employed traditional sf tropes and themes in colorful space epics or gritty near-future thrillers that were generally well received but did not seem to break new ground like Egan.

Meanwhile, the British Renaissance that had been building up a head of steam throughout the decade finally attracted critical and popular attention. Since there is no consensus on its nature (critics still dispute whether it continues or has run its course), it would be foolish to expect any generally recognized starting point. We might, however, triangulate the moment as lying somewhere between Iain M. Banks's exuberant left-wing space opera, Consider Phlebas (1987), Colin Greenland's reworking of the planetary romance, Take Back Plenty (1990), and David Pringle and Colin Greenland's 1984 Interzone (1982-) editorial calling for a “radical hard sf.” These stimuli revived interest in forms of sf that predated the literary experimentation and belated “modernism” of the New Wave, while insisting on literary quality and playful postmodern sensibilities.

The Renaissance that grew out of these starting points has therefore tended to look back to older forms of sf. Stephen Baxter is generally recognized as being one of the best hard-sf writers of his generation despite (or perhaps because of) a propensity for imagining the extinction of the human race. Nevertheless, his most accomplished novels include: a revisiting of H.G. Wells's The Time Machine (1895) in The Time Ships (1995); Voyage (1996), an alternate history about the continuation of the American space program after the Apollo missions; and Titan (1997), about a doomed space mission leaving a self-destructive Earth. The backwards look of these works has found more overt expression in a series of collaborations with Arthur C. Clarke, and also in novels that owe more to historical fiction than to sf. Paul McAuley has similarly written hard sf sensitive to the genre's past. Eternal Light (1991) had a cosmic scale reminiscent of Clarke, while the clotted imagery and vivacious invention of the Confluence sequence (1997-9) recalled an earlier generation of science fantasy. McAuley's finest work, however, was Fairyland (1995), a clear-eyed and often disturbing engagement with the prospects and possibilities of genetic engineering which managed to incorporate mythic archetypes and ideas of the posthuman without ever losing its grittily realist tone. And similarly, McAuley has drifted away from sf, in his case to a series of contemporary or near-future thrillers.

The other two leading British sf writers who came to maturity in the early 1990s both used their work to explore ideas of postcolonialism. In her early works, notably Escape Plans (1986) and Kairos (1988), Gwyneth Jones had already shown the keen interest in power relationships that lies at the heart of her Aleutian trilogy (White Queen (1991), North Wind (1994), Phoenix Café (1997)), which tells of an Earth colonized by enigmatic aliens and how we react to our new role, through subservience, rebellion, collaboration, and, in some of its most arresting images, by trying to make ourselves like the alien. At the turn of the century, Bold as Love (2001) began a new sequence of five novels which cast power relationships in a new light by playing out a 1960s hippy dream of rock stars taking over from politicians. Using magic and with overt Arthurian overtones, they are closer to fantasy than sf, but are interesting to note because of their portrayal of a near-future Britain torn apart politically, socially, and culturally. The island divided was a common feature in British sf of the mid- to late 1990s, occurring, for instance, in Michael Marshall Smith's Only Forward (1994) and Ken MacLeod's The Star Fraction (1995). It is tempting to see in its very ubiquity a response to the divisive premiership of Margaret Thatcher, who had been forced from office only a few years previously. Certainly, those writers whose work expresses a deeply held leftist politics have more recently reacted to the authoritarian leanings of Tony Blair's government with visions of a grim and repressive state, as in MacLeod's “The Human Front” (2001) and Hal Duncan's Ink (2007). Reaction to the repression accompanying the “War on Terror” has also prompted the most savage and powerful novel that Brian Aldiss has written in 20 years or more, HARM (2007).

That part of Britain most afflicted by divisiveness throughout the 1990s was, of course, Northern Ireland, where Ian McDonald used sf to explore the human effects of the Troubles, most effectively in Sacrifice of Fools (1996), in which aliens settle in Northern Ireland, profoundly changing the nature of the sectarian divide. Humans struggling to cope with the consequences of a generally indifferent alien incursion is a feature of McDonald's work. Chaga (1995), in which an alien arrival in Africa slowly but ineluctably changes everything to a crystalline structure, drew comparisons with early work by J.G. Ballard. Indeed, a charge commonly leveled against McDonald was that he used other writers' ideas, themes, and devices, although he employed them to purposes very much his own. However, by the time of River of Gods (2004), a kaleidoscopic portrayal of how various levels of Indian society are affected in a near future of water shortages and spreading digital culture, he had clearly found his own distinctive voice.

If Jones and McDonald are writers with distinct political agendas, British sf, ever since the days of Wells, has commonly expressed a left-leaning perspective. But few writers in the history of the genre have taken such a pronounced position as Ken MacLeod. His friend Iain M. Banks had already grafted left-wing utopian thinking onto a traditional space-operatic format in his Culture novels, but even at their best (Excession (1996), Look to Windward (2000)) they have been more notable for their humor and bravura invention than their politics. His non-Culture novels, often dazzling in their literary skill and invention (Feersum Endjin (1994)), have been less successful, and his habit of alternating sf with mainstream novels (several of which contain science-fictional elements) may have blunted some of the impact of his work. Certainly nothing had prepared the way for the concentrated political charge of MacLeod's early novels. His first four books, The Star Fraction (1995), The Stone Canal (1996), The Cassini Division (1998), and The Sky Road (1999), are generally grouped together as the Fall Revolution quartet, although the linkages between them are looser than that might imply. They might have some characters in common, but none of them takes place in exactly the same history of the world as the others. What links them is the way they explore different aspects of socialist and communist philosophy; it is hard to think of any other works which use political theory as the basis for witty, fast-paced adventure novels. Subsequent novels, with the politics more low-key, were less distinctive, often involving very traditional sf tropes (e.g., first contact in Learning the World (2005)), but The Execution Channel (2007) takes an impassioned political stance which enlivens its updating of the traditional British catastrophe novel, turning it into a howl of outrage at the iniquities perpetrated in the so-called War on Terror.

By the late 1990s a new generation of British writers was emerging. More than that, there were suddenly more British writers than ever before, and more British books demanding attention across the world. Spurred by a sense (from Greenland and Banks) that traditional sf could be given a new lease of life and (from Jones and MacLeod) that it could be made a vehicle for political views, encouraged by a growth in markets (Interzone was now securely established, a number of small magazines would appear and disappear throughout the 1980s and 1990s, while internet sites that started to appear from the mid-1990s were blind to the national origins of submissions), renewed critical attention and other factors (such as the Arthur C. Clarke Award, first awarded in 1987), Britain suddenly seemed to be fertile ground for new writing. Soon, and for the first time since at least the 1960s, British publishers' sf lists included a predominance of British writers, and the publishers were competing to proclaim their latest discoveries. (It should however be noted that some prominent British writers, such as Brian Stableford with his six-volume Emortality sequence (1998-2002), were still only being published in the US.) In 2005, all five nominees for the Hugo Award for best novel were British, as were, for the only time so far, the six shortlisted for the Clarke Award in 2006. For the first time since the New Wave, British sf was being perceived as a vital and important force in the genre.

New writers such as Jon Courtenay Grimwood explored issues of racial and individual identity, most intriguingly in his Arabesk alternate history sequence (Pashazade (2001), Effendi (2002), Felaheen (2003)). Set in Alexandria, the novels combined cyberpunk and crime thriller in a story in which personal and political struggles for identity mirror each other. In later novels, Grimwood has striven to achieve the same effect, with stories that deliberately show cultures in conflict, but without achieving quite the same balance between genres.

Something of the same political intent, if with a very different impetus and aesthetic, can be found in the work of China Miéville. Perdido Street Station (2000), The Scar (2002), and Iron Council (2004), loosely linked novels set in and around a sprawling city, New Crobuzon, present an astonishing milieu of strange beings engaged in direct and recognizable political action. Carefully judged to straddle sf, fantasy, and horror, they never fall clearly into one genre or another. In a sense, they represent another version of the irrational, in which the transgeneric form can allow anything to happen, although this particular expression has been more readily described as “New Weird.” However, although a direct line of descent can be traced from Miéville's work back to M. John Harrison's Viriconium novels and stories, New Weird as a movement would seem to have no other readily identifiable exponents, the closest among contemporary writers being perhaps Hal Duncan in his exuberant diptych exploring contemporary irrationality, Vellum (2005) and Ink.

As for Harrison, his novel Light (2002) marked a return to sf after a series of novels that had blended the fantastic with the grittily contemporary. His first space opera since The Centauri Device (1974), on the surface it was an example of pure sf, exploring the Kefahuchi Tract where the flotsam of space-faring races is swept up. Closer examination, however, raises questions about how much the typical images of decay and entropy actually represent a real future or the psychological breakdown of the antihero of the present-day sections of the novel. A sequel of sorts, Nova Swing (2006), does nothing to settle these questions, while seeming to further tie this future into contemporary irrationality. It is perhaps worth noting that Justina Robson, having begun her career with finely judged explorations of moral doubt in the near future (Mappa Mundi (2001)), has moved toward a similarly space-operatic mode (Natural History (2003), Living Next Door to the God of Love (2005)) in which contemporary moral uncertainties feed into an unsettling posthuman profusion. In recent sf it seems that both the computer and the spaceship lead into places where anything goes and hence nothing need be real.

If this brief survey suggests that the whole of the British Renaissance has been concerned with subverting traditional tropes to social, political, or literary ends, it is worth pointing out that sf has always explored such ideas. Nevertheless a number of writers (including Mary Gentle, Peter F. Hamilton, Richard K. Morgan, Alastair Reynolds, Adam Roberts, Tricia Sullivan, Steph Swainston, and Liz Williams) have produced good and at times excellent work which has taken a far more traditional approach to the exploration of sf ideas. Still others have written sf as if they were writing a contemporary mainstream novel in which the idea is not so much the hero as the trigger for an exploration of human emotions and relationships. For example, in Air (2005) by Geoff Ryman (the leading proponent of “mundane sf,” though whether Air counts as such is another matter), the science-fictional idea is an extension of the internet directly into people's brains; but the novel's focus, and what makes it so powerful, is a detailed and humane examination of the effects this has, both good and bad, on the people in a remote Asian village as they struggle to discover the extent to which their traditional way of life and social relationships can be maintained in the face of it.

Others have written in a similar mode, notably Christopher Priest, who continues to plough a generally very lonely furrow in the sf field. Building on a personal iconography involving twins, doubles, mirrors, and replications, he presents, in coldly precise terms, reasons to question the very reality we occupy. In The Prestige (1995), rival stage magicians at the turn of the twentieth century engage in an escalating war of sabotage against each other that brings into alarming focus the cost of holding on to individual identity. In The Extremes (1999), twin massacres in Britain and America are linked by virtual reality. In The Separation (2002), one of two twins is killed on the day Rudolf Hess flies to Britain, with the death of one leading to a history not precisely like our own, the death of the other resulting in peace in 1942. Priest extends the issue of personal identity to explore how who we are determines the world we occupy.

Priest is one of a number of sf writers who have flirted with the mainstream, but it is also worth noting the number of mainstream writers who have flirted, often very successfully, with sf in this period, many using alternative history scenarios to examine moral issues. Philip Roth's The Plot Against America (2004) looks at the effect on American Jews if the country had embraced fascism in the 1940s; Michael Chabon's The Yiddish Policemen's Union (2007) looks at Jews making a homeland in Alaska after being expelled from Israel in 1948; Owen Sheers's Resistance (2007) looks at the effect of a successful German invasion of Britain in 1944. Not all, however, have taken this route. Margaret Atwood, despite deriding sf in at least one ill-judged essay, has nevertheless used its tropes consistently and knowledgeably, perhaps most successfully in Oryx and Crake (2003), set in a depopulated future world, although it is far less forbidding than the stark post-apocalyptic world of Cormac McCarthy's The Road (2006). Amitav Ghosh's The Calcutta Chromosome (1996) uses sf to examine colonial issues surrounding work on malaria in British India; Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go (2005) takes cloning as a metaphor in an elegiac study of the fragility of personal relationships; Audrey Niffenegger's The Time Traveler's Wife (2004) has a character cut loose in time to produce one of the most haunting love stories of recent years; and perhaps most ambitiously David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas (2004) embeds two sf tales, a near-future dystopia and a far-future post-apocalypse, within a complex examination of human predation that stretches from the nineteenth century to the end of life on this planet and back again.

As the British Renaissance waxed and then appeared to start waning, a new generation of American sf writers began to appear. Throughout this period, sales of the main sf magazines were declining and the outlets through which new writers could make a name for themselves with short stories were decreasing. Taking matters into their own hands, younger writers created new venues for their work: self-published chapbooks, anthologies such as the Polyphony series, magazines such as Lady Churchill's Rosebud Wristlet, and websites such as Strange Horizons. A number of prolific writers have emerged by this route, including Jay Lake, Christopher Barzak, Robert Wexler, and Nick Mamatas, although it remains to be seen how many of these might make a lasting impression on the genre. Despite the success of sf novels such as Aestival Tide (1992) and Glimmering (1997), Elizabeth Hand has made more impact in fantasy, while Paul DiFilippo (Joe's Liver (2000), Fuzzy Dice (2003)) has been perhaps too wayward and varied in his writing to achieve the recognition his work sometimes deserves. Some newer writers have restricted themselves to short fiction but still achieved notable success, especially Ted Chiang (Stories of your Life and Others (2002)) and Kelly Link (Stranger Things Happen (2001)). Others have produced acclaimed novels, particularly David Marusek (Counting Heads (2005)) and Peter Watts (Blindsight (2006)). Chiang, Link, Marusek, and Watts are perhaps the most talented new writers to emerge since 2000, but in some respects the most telling recent debuts have been by John Scalzi (Old Man's War (2005), The Ghost Brigade (2006)) and Elizabeth Bear (Hammered (2005), Scardown (2005), Worldwired (2005)). Both very deliberately chose to write in the old-fashioned - some would say played-out - subgenre of militaristic sf, and both reimagined and reinvigorated the mode before moving on to produce very different sf. In other words, they seem to be following, perhaps unconsciously and without the clear political agenda, a similar process to that which helped to produce the British Renaissance.

But, as Ho Chi Minh once said when asked about the effects of the French Revolution, it is too soon to tell. How any of these works will stand the test of time, which will prove significant in the history of sf, even whether sf has got a future at all, are things we will discover only in the fullness of time.",,2137948322,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Kincaid, Paul"," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

2. Nineteenth-Century SF (Part I: History),"The sf genre obtained its name and social identity during the early decades of the twentieth century in the American pulp magazines. But a recognizable literary tradition was, according to many critics, conceived during the industrial revolution and born during the latter half of the nineteenth century in Jules Verne's voyages extraordinaires and H.G. Wells's fin-de-siècle “scientific romances.” These two sf variants pioneered by Verne and Wells (hard/didactic versus speculative/fantastic) became the two major modes that have dominated the genre ever since.

The explosion of sf-type narratives during the nineteenth century can be understood only within the historical context of the industrial revolution and the transformative (and often alienating) social changes that accompanied it. The generally positive and positivist outlooks common in certain late-Enlightenment works such as Louis-Sébastien Mercier's futurist utopia The Year 2440 (1771) and Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet's Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind (1795) soon metamorphosed into their dark counterpart in works such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus (1818). Moving the source of terror from the supernatural to the scientific, Shelley's Gothic novel exemplified the Romantic rejection of the eighteenth-century Cartesian belief in the scientist as hero and in technology as inherently good. Frankenstein expressed the fears of an entire mal-du-siècle generation caught in a sudden paradigm shift between tradition and modernity. As such, the novel proved to be highly influential and popularized what was to become a standard nineteenth-century sf archetype: the mad scientist who, in his hubris-filled pursuit of knowledge and power, betrays basic human values. Notable works before and after Frankenstein that feature such Faustian scientists include E.T.A. Hoffman's “The Sandman” (1816), Honoré de Balzac's The Centenarian (1822) and The Search for the Absolute (1834), Nathaniel Hawthorne's “The Birthmark” (1843) and “Rappaccini's Daughter” (1846), Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886), Robert Cromie's The Crack of Doom (1895), H.G. Wells's The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), and Jules Verne's The Master of the World (1904), among many others. Finally, although some sf historians have proclaimed Mary Shelley's novel the “ur-text” for the entire sf genre, others disagree, insisting that “SF is a literature of technologically saturated societies” and a “genre that can therefore emerge only relatively late in modernity . . . a popular literature that concerns the impact of Mechanism (to use the older term for technology) on cultural life and human subjectivity” (Luckhurst 2005: 3).

As European society continued to mutate amid rapid industrial growth, the spread of new technologies, and various political upheavals, a new and radical idea began to take hold: that the future could be very different from the past. From this basic notion emerged a second sf thematic strand that proliferated throughout the nineteenth century: futuristic fiction. Félix Bodin's novel/manifesto The Novel of the Future (1834) argued for the importance of this new genre and described how such narratives, filled with the wonders of the scientific age, would constitute the epic literature of tomorrow (Alkon 1987: 245-89). About three decades earlier, in 1805, Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville had already broken new cognitive ground in The Last Man by visualizing the Christian apocalypse in secular terms (an approach adopted by Mary Shelley in 1826 in a novel of the same name in which she imagines a plague wiping out the world's population). And, near the close of the century, Camille Flammarion's Omega: the last days of the world (1894) posited a kind of astronomical-cum-spiritualist apocalypse occasioned by the heat-death of our solar system. Other future-catastrophe (though not necessarily end-of-the-world) fictions from this period include Richard Jefferies's After London (1885), a post-holocaust novel in which England reverts to barbarism, and numerous cautionary future-war stories beginning with George Chesney's seminal invasion tale The Battle of Dorking, published in 1871, discussed in detail in I.F. Clarke (1992).

Much of the futuristic fiction of the nineteenth century sought to portray - either positively or negatively - humanity's social “progress” in the years to come. One imaginative and light-hearted example was Jane Webb-Loudon's The Mummy! A tale of the twenty-second century (1827), an elaborate science fantasy that pokes fun at her own society's foibles by means of an eccentric scientist's resuscitation of the mummy of Egyptian pharaoh Cheops who promptly travels to London (by dirigible) and begins to take an active role in the political affairs of the day. Other satiric works about the future include Émile Souvestre's comically dystopian The World as it Shall Be (1846) which depicts a world in the year 3000 that has air conditioning, designer drinking waters, steam-driven submarines, and phrenology-based education. Also full of humor and wonderfully illustrated by its author is Albert Robida's The Twentieth Century (1883), which recounts the adventures of a young woman named Hélène who is attempting to find a career in an extrapolated (and surprisingly feminist) Paris of 1952 where aircabs and high-tech pneumatic tubes transport citizens around the city, where each home contains a “telephotoscope” to broadcast the latest news and entertainment, and where the government is swept out of office every ten years in a planned “decennial revolution.” Robida's other futuristic novels include War in the Twentieth Century (1887), The Electric Life (1892), and a unique time-reversal fantasy The Clock of the Ages (1902).

More serious utopias of the future were plentiful during the nineteenth century, but the role of scientific technology in their makeup differed greatly from one to the next. Consider, for example, Samuel Butler's Erewhon (1872), which visualized an anti-technology paradise in which machines have been banned from society for fear that they will evolve and eventually replace humans; or Edward Maitland's By and By: an historical romance of the future (1873), a Victorian “three-decker” novel that portrays an advanced pro-science society existing in a future Africa where, among its other technological feats, it has irrigated the Sahara Desert; or W.H. Hudson's A Crystal Age (1887), which depicts a futuristic ecological utopia whose citizens, organized as a matriarchal society, live in total harmony with nature. The most important example of this sf subgenre, Edward Bellamy's hugely popular Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (1888), imagines a reason-based and technology-driven “socialist” utopia in Boston in the year 2000. Bellamy's novel quickly became an international bestseller, and “Bellamy Clubs” began to spring up across America to discuss Bellamy's political ideas. Looking Backward also sparked the publication of many other futuristic utopias and dystopias during the fin-de-siècle period of 1890-1900. Notable among these were William Morris's dreamily pastoral News from Nowhere (1890) and Ignatius Donnelly's grim vision of a capitalistic New York City that is destroyed from within by its disenfranchised and enraged lower classes in Caesar's Column (1890).

Not all later-century utopias were written in reaction to Bellamy, and in particular there was a strain of speculative fantasy written by women writers that inflected feminist aspirations, often dramatizing separatist versions of women-only futures: examples include Mary E. Bradley Lane's Mizora: a world of women (1880), Elizabeth Corbett's man-free New Amazonia: a foretaste of the future (1889), and Lady Florence Dixie's Gloriana, or the Revolution of 1900 (1890), which maps a future revolution that leads to an England that achieves peace and prosperity under female rule.

Another important sf strain to emerge during the nineteenth century featured explorations of the distant past, and of ancient “lost” worlds. Edward Page Mitchell's protagonists travel back to a pivotal historical moment in sixteenth-century Holland in “The Clock that Went Backward” (1881), Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889) travels in time back to sixth-century Arthurian England in this satire on humanity's seemingly endless capacity for violence and folly, and in Grant Allen's The British Barbarians (1895) an anthropologist from the future travels back in time to study present-day England. Paleoanthropology is the main focus of the new emerging subgenre of prehistoric fiction which began with Pierre Boitard's Paris before Man (1861), was popularized in Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), and found its most elaborate expression in Stanley Waterloo's The Story of Ab: a tale of the time of the cave men (1897), and in the novels Vamireh (1892), Eyrimah (1896), and Quest for Fire (1911) by the prolific but mostly untranslated French writer J.-H. Rosny aîné. An entire civilization living within our hollow Earth is discovered by Captain Adam Seaborn in his Symzonia: a voyage of discovery (1820), the first of many nineteenth-century works to describe an unknown race, species, or culture existing within a hidden corner of our world. Others include Edward Bulwer-Lytton's subterranean Vril-ya in The Coming Race (1871), James DeMille's Antarctic race of Kosekin in Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder (1888), William R. Bradshaw's hollow-Earth Plutusians and Calnogorians in The Goddess of Atvatabar (1892), and several short stories on the lost-race theme by Rosny such as “Nymphea” (1893), “The Depths of Kyamo” (1896), and “The Prodigious Country of the Caverns” (1896). But it was the Victorian novelist H. Rider Haggard who would prove to be the master of this brand of lost-world fiction with his internationally bestselling adventure tales, including King Solomon's Mines (1885), She (1886), Allan Quatermain (1887), and The People of the Mist (1894).

The growing popularity of “hard science” sf - exemplified by the success of Jules Verne's novels during the latter half of the nineteenth century - may be traced (somewhat ironically given his reputation in his homeland) to the work of American poet, writer, and critic Edgar Allan Poe. Identified by Hugo Gernsback in the first issue of his Amazing Stories (1926-2005) as one of the three founders of what he called the genre of “scientifiction” (along with Verne and Wells), Poe pioneered the use of scientific detail to enhance the verisimilitude of his fantastic stories. His admittedly tongue-in-cheek note added to the lunar voyage of “The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaal” (1835), for example, could almost stand as a first manifesto for hard sf as he urges “the application of scientific principles” to increase “the plausibility of the details of the voyage itself” (Poe 1978: 1001). The status of Poe's reputation as an early originator of the genre is directly proportional to the variety of sf themes and “narrative frameworks for bold scientific speculation” (Stableford 2003: 19) that he incorporated into his speculative tales: the mechanics of balloon flight in “The Balloon Hoax” (1844), the “science” of mesmerism in “A Tale of the Ragged Mountains” (1844) and “The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar” (1845), the future destruction of Earth by a comet in “The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion” (1839), the discovery of lost worlds in “MS Found in a Bottle” (1833) and The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (1838), and a futuristic utopia in “Mellonta Tauta” (1849). From his first published poems “Sonnet to Science” (1829) and “Al Aaraaf” (1829) to his last published philosophical essay called Eureka (1848), Poe repeatedly attempted to reconcile a scientific outlook with a sentimental religious mysticism - a Weltanschauung that, later in the century, would permeate the work of writers such as Flammarion and Rosny aîné.

Poe's influence on Jules Verne at the beginning of the latter's writing career was pivotal. After reading Baudelaire's translation of Poe's stories (titled, significantly, Histoires extraordinaires), Verne penned his only piece of literary criticism, an essay “Edgard Poë and his Works,” published in the popular magazine Musée des familles (1833-1900) in 1864. Verne begins his article by praising Poe, explaining some aspects of Poe's life, and analyzing lengthy excerpts from Poe's stories. Verne then goes on to say: “they occupy an important place in the history of imaginative works because Poë created a distinct literary genre all his own” (Verne 1864: 194). It was not Poe's taste for the macabre, nor his odd penchant for hoax-humor, nor his technophobia that attracted Jules Verne to his imaginative fiction (Alkon 1994: 101-7). It was rather his attention to detail and his ability to make the bizarre believable and the extraordinary ordinary. In other words, it was Poe's use of scientific verisimilitude that impressed Verne. Although Verne went on to borrow extensively from Poe's oeuvre (balloons, cryptograms, maelstroms, mesmerism, even the entire narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym), it was actually Poe's style that had the greatest impact on the future author of the Extraordinary Voyages.

Sometimes called the “Father of Science Fiction,” Jules Verne popularized in the early 1860s a new hybrid fictional genre which he dubbed the roman scientifique (the scientific novel). Developed under the strict tutelage of his editor/publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, Verne's narrative recipe was as follows: an educational and fast-paced adventure tale heavily flavored with scientific didacticism, mixing equal parts of drama, humor, and “sense of wonder,” and seasoned with a large pinch of positivistic Saint-Simonian ideology. After the publication and success of his first scientific novel about an aerial trek across darkest Africa called Five Weeks in a Balloon (1863), Verne told his friends at the Paris Stock Market where he had been working part-time to make ends meet: “My friends, I bid you adieu. I've had an idea . . . an idea that should make me rich. I've just written a novel in a new style . . . If it succeeds, it will be a gold mine” (Evans 1988a: 21). And a gold mine it soon proved to be, not only for Verne and his publisher but also for the history of speculative fiction. Verne went on to write more than sixty scientific novels from 1863 until his death in 1905. Most first appeared in serial format in Hetzel's family periodical the Magasin d'éducation et de récréation (1864-1916) and then reprinted as luxury, fully illustrated octavo editions. Collectively, these novels were called the voyages extraordinaires, and they were published with a specific educative purpose: to help compensate for the lack of science instruction in France's Catholic-controlled schools. As Hetzel explained in his 1866 editorial preface to the collection: “The goal of this series is, in fact, to outline all the geographical, geological, physical, and astronomical knowledge amassed by modern science and to recount, in an entertaining and picturesque format that is his own, the history of the universe” (Evans 1988a: 30).

Marketing hyperbole aside, Hetzel's preface articulates an explicit goal for Verne's scientific novels: to teach the natural sciences through the imaginative medium of “armchair voyages.” It was partly this social function that allowed Verne's hard/ didactic sf to establish a successful “institutional 'landing point' and ideological model” for the genre (Angenot 1978: 64). From the geology and paleontology of Journey to the Center of the Earth to the physics of spaceflight in From the Earth to the Moon (1865) and from the oceanography and marine biology of Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas (1869) to the chemistry and applied engineering of The Mysterious Island (1875), Verne's narratives sought to teach science through fiction, not to develop fiction through science (or, in many instances, pseudoscience), as in the case of Wells, Rosny, and other early practitioners of speculative/fantastic sf. The difference between these two fundamental types of sf can be best illustrated by analyzing the role played by science itself in the discursive structure of these narratives - i.e., the manner in which a sustained scientific discourse is grafted onto a literary one. Verne's hard/didactic sf presumes a predominantly pedagogical function for such scientific discourse. In contrast, the primary goal of the science in speculative/fantastic sf is more expositional: to facilitate plot progression, to help create special effects and reader estrangement, and to build verisimilitude. That is to say, the “raison d'être of science in the narrative process itself shifts from primary position to secondary, from subject to context. It seeks no longer to address the reasoning intellect but rather the creative imagination” (Evans 1988b: 1).

Counterbalancing their sometimes heavy doses of scientific didacticism, three other aspects of Verne's romans scientifiques enhanced their appeal: their epic scope and visions of unlimited mobility, their quest-Bildungsroman and “initiatory” narrative structure, and their evocative portrayals of technology (especially vehicular). As exciting voyages to destinations “where no man had gone before,” Verne's novels transported his readers to a host of geographical “supreme points” (Butor 1949: 3) - those impenetrable and richly mythic locales such as the North and South Poles in The Adventures of Captain Hatteras (1866) and The Ice Sphinx (1897), the Amazon jungles in The Jangada (1881), the hidden depths of the oceans in Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas, the dark side of the Moon in Around the Moon (1870), or even the distant planets of our solar system in Hector Servadac (1877). Most such fictional journeys in Verne's oeuvre are structured around a basic quest motif such as the search to find a missing father or husband as in The Children of Captain Grant (1867) and Mistress Branican (1891), mapping an unexplored region as in The Adventures of Three Russians and Three English (1872), or surviving as castaways on a deserted island as in The Mysterious Island or A Two-Year Vacation (1888). Most feature scientist/student or mentor/acolyte characters such as Lidenbrock/Axel of Journey to the Center of the Earth or Octave/Marcel of The Begum's Millions (1879) who serve to model growth and learning. And most include a truly memorable piece of technology - Verne's famous “dream machines.” From Captain Nemo's spacious submarine Nautilus, to Barbicane's aluminum space-bullet (so similar to Apollo 11's), to Robur's powerful helicopter airship Albatross, to the steam-powered overland locomotive (fashioned to resemble an Indian elephant) of The Steam House (1880), to the many different modes of transport (both high-tech and low) used by Phileas Fogg in his circumnavigation of the globe in Around the World in 80 Days (1873), these fictional people-movers represented a new industrial-age utopian ideal: “facility of movement in a moving world - 'Mobilis in mobili' as Captain Nemo would say” (Evans 1999: 99).

It is important to note that Verne's post-1887 novels, written after Hetzel's death, sometimes reflect a dramatic change of tone when compared with his earlier and more celebrated voyages extraordinaires: the latter tend more often to be Romantic, pessimistic, nostalgic, and even fiercely anti-Progress (reminiscent of some of his pre-Hetzel short stories such as “Master Zacharius” (1854) or his “lost” novel, the dystopian Paris in the Twentieth Century, rejected by Hetzel in 1863). As might be expected, the scientific pedagogy in these later texts appears severely abridged, watered down, or cut out altogether. Themes of environmental concern, human morality, and social responsibility grow more prevalent. Non-scientists are more often chosen as the stories' heroes, and what hero-scientists remain are increasingly portrayed as crazed megalomaniacs who use their special knowledge for purposes of world domination and/or unlimited riches. A striking example of these changes can be seen in the final volumes of Verne's “serial” novels: the trilogy of From the Earth to the Moon, Around the Moon (1870), and Topsy-Turvy (1889) and the two-novel series of Robur the Conqueror (1886) and Master of the World (1904). In Topsy-Turvy the heroic feats of ballistic engineering by Barbicane's Gun Club become (quite literally, at least in ambition) Earth-shaking when, instead of “shooting” a manned capsule around the Moon, they now seek to alter the angle of the planet's axis with the blast of a gigantic cannon. Wholly indifferent to the catastrophic environmental and human damage that would necessarily result from such a project, their scheme is to melt the Earth's polar ice cap in order to uncover vast mineral wealth for themselves. Similarly, in Master of the World the genius aviator Robur is brought back into the limelight, but it soon becomes evident that the once-heroic Übermensch of the skies has degenerated into a maniacal madman who now threatens global terrorism with his high-tech devices. Other post-1887 Verne novels target additional social and environmental issues: the cruel oppression of the Québécois people in Canada in Family without a Name (1889), the plague of politicians and missionaries destroying Polynesian island cultures in Propeller Island (1895), the environmental pollution caused by the oil industry in The Last Will of an Eccentric (1899), and the slaughter of elephants for their ivory in The Village in the Treetops (1901), among others.

Verne's imprint on the developing genre of sf during the nineteenth century was both deep and lasting. Because of his unprecedented success, writers from around the world soon began to imitate Verne's hard/didactic romans scientifiques and their emphasis on travel, science, and technology: in France, Louis Boussenard's The Secrets of Mr Synthesis (1888), Henry de Graffigny and Georges Le Faure's multi-volumed Extraordinary Adventures of a Russian Scientist (1889-96), and Paul d'Ivoi's action-packed series called the Voyages excentriques (1894-1914); in England and Germany, the many fictional works of Francis Henry Atkins (aka Frank Aubrey) and Robert Kraft; in Russia, the “geographic fantasies” of Vladimir Obruchev; in America, Edward S. Ellis's frontier sf western The Steam Man of the Prairies (1868), E.E. Hale's satellite story “The Brick Moon” (1869), Frank R. Stockton's The Great War Syndicate (1889), and the many Frank Reade Jr and Tom Edison Jr “invention” stories by Luis Senarens and other “dime-novel” writers who flourished toward the end of the century.

Since his death in 1905, Jules Verne's reputation within the French literary canon, among English-language readers and among contemporary sf scholars, has undergone many changes. In his native France, beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, Verne's oeuvre finally shed its stigma as paraliterature and joined the respectable literary mainstream; today his novels are taught in French universities. Verne's literary status in the UK and USA, however, continues to suffer from poor English translations, sensationalistic Hollywood adaptations, and a cultural mythology that persists in portraying him as an icon of “sci-fi” futurism. Fortunately, the past two decades have witnessed a growing renaissance of Anglophone interest in Verne that has resulted in many improved translations of his works, several new and accurate biographies, an online international fanbase, and a dramatic upsurge in the number of academic studies devoted to his fiction (Har'El; Evans 2008).

An important strand of non-Vernian speculative/fantastic sf that continued to develop throughout the nineteenth century - and surged after the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859 - involves encounters with aliens and extraterrestrials. Imagining life on other worlds as a means for creating off-world utopias had been an important theme in sf at least since Francis Godwin's The Man in the Moone or, a discourse of a voyage thither by Domingo Gonsales, the speedy messenger (1638) and Cyrano de Bergerac's The Other World, or the States and Empires of the Moon (1657). Joseph Atterley (George Tucker) continued this rich tradition with his 1827 lunar romance A Voyage to the Moon. Charles Defontenay's Star, or Psi Cassiopeia (1854) is a much more ambitious work, which describes an entire “Starian” civilization inhabiting the planet Psi in the constellation of Cassiopeia. Percy Greg's Across the Zodiac (1880), Robert Cromie's Plunge into Space (1891), and Gustavus Pope's Journey to Mars (1894) all locate their alien societies on Mars (and also manage to find romance on the red planet) whereas in Kurd Lasswitz's On Two Planets (1897) a thriving Martian colony is discovered at the Earth's North Pole; finally, John Jacob Astor's A Journey in Other Worlds (1894) recounts an interplanetary tour of our solar system where the protagonists encounter, among other oddities, Earth-like dinosaurs on Jupiter and spirits of the dead on Saturn. In this latter vein of mystical alien encounters, special mention must be made of French astronomer Camille Flammarion whose oeuvre oscillates curiously between the solidly scientific (for instance his enormously successful Popular Astronomy, first published in 1875), the nonfictional but highly speculative (his 1862 The Plurality of Inhabited Worlds, which he describes the types of alien life that might exist on other planets in our solar system), and the profoundly spiritualist (his 1872 Lumen which depicts conversations with a spirit who, traveling faster than the speed of light, encounters different alien lifeforms throughout the cosmos). Other sf tales about alien lifeforms who occupy the interstices of different dimensions include Fitz-James O'Brien's 1858 “The Diamond Lens” which describes a man's doomed love for a microscopic woman living in a drop of water, Edwin Abbott's delightful mathematical fable Flatland (1884) whose narrator, A. Square, lives in a two-dimensional world, and several fin-de-siècle sf stories by Rosny such as “Another World” (1895), where interdimensional alien species, wholly invisible to our limited senses, coexist with humanity on Earth. Also notable is Rosny's “The Xipéhuz” (1887), which chronicles an encounter between a nomadic tribe in Mesopotamia and a geometric-shaped and intelligent - yet totally inscrutable - race of alien energy-beings. Many years later, Rosny would transpose this xenobiological theme to an end-of-the-world narrative format in The Death of the Earth (1910), where the human species is finally superseded by a mineral-based alien species called the ferromagnétaux. Finally, Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's Future Eve (1886) initiated yet another - presciently postmodern - variant of “alien” sf with his wondrous android named Hadaly: a self-aware robot invented by Thomas Alva Edison as the “perfect” female but whose very existence raises a host of aesthetic and ontological questions about the “artificiality of contemporary existence” (Roberts 2006: 123). Whether expressed as a utopian society on the Moon, as a nonhuman civilization inhabiting a distant planet or another dimension of space/time, or as a synthetic lifeform created as an exact simulacrum of ourselves, the recurring theme of the alien in nineteenth-century sf encapsulates one of the core values of the genre: the experience of alterity.

At the end of the nineteenth century, this developing mode of speculative/fantastic sf grew to full maturity with the “scientific romances” of H.G. Wells. Wells bridged the nineteenth and twentieth centuries both literally and symbolically. Although his writing career was long and prolific, the visionary novels that would inspire generations of sf writers after him were written during the brief period of 1895 to 1914. As mentioned, Wells's brand of sf is quite different from and extends beyond Verne's roman scientifique model in at least two fundamental ways. First, his fictions do not seek to teach science per se but rather to view the universe through scientific eyes. As Brian Stableford defined it, the Wellsian scientific romance “is a story which is built around something glimpsed through a window of possibility from which scientific discovery has drawn back the curtain” (Stableford 1985: 8). Second, Wells's fiction uses science more as an enabling literary device to enhance the verisimilitude and deepen the emotional impact of his fantastic visions. As the author himself explained, “Hitherto, except in exploration fantasies, the fantastic element was brought in by magic . . . It occurred to me that . . . an ingenious use of scientific patter might with advantage be substituted” (Wells 1934: viii). In other words, the science in Wells's scientific romances made his “thought experiments” more plausible, allowing readers to focus more fully on the human ramifications of the story: “So soon as the hypothesis is launched, the whole interest becomes the interest of looking at human feelings and human ways, from the new angle that has been acquired” (Wells 1934: viii).

Wells's creative genius was to breathe new life into the many sf topoi and tropes that he inherited from the sf tradition that preceded him, pushing them toward new cognitive and aesthetic frontiers. With his first novel, The Time Machine (1895), for example, Wells gave an innovative twist to the time-travel tale by offering a chilling portrayal of humanity evolving into Eloi and Morlocks by the year AD 802701 and, millions of years beyond that, of the end of the human species altogether on a dying planet Earth. Wells's next sf novel, The Island of Doctor Moreau, was a powerful reworking of the Frankenstein motif that dared to satirize organized religion (Wells later described it as an “exercise in youthful blasphemy”). Another moralistic mad-scientist tale followed, The Invisible Man (1897), where the physicist Griffin's discovery of the secret of invisibility transforms him into an insane megalomaniac who must be hunted down and killed. An ingenious interplanetary adaptation of the Chesney future-war novel, Wells's The War of the Worlds (1898) and its imagined Martian invasion took advantage of the public's heightened interest in the red planet following the publication of Percival Lowell's provocative book Mars in 1895. Wells also dabbled in the sf subgenres of prehistoric fiction, planetary disaster fiction, and lost-race fiction in “The Grisly Folk” (1896), “A Story of the Stone Age” (1897), “The Star” (1897), and “The Country of the Blind” (1904). He tried his hand at a Vernian lunar voyage in The First Men in the Moon (1901), using an anti-gravity substance called “Cavorite” (which prompted disapproving scolds from Verne). And finally, he produced several highly foresighted futuristic utopias such as A Modern Utopia (1905) and In the Days of the Comet (1906), as well as a number of prescient future-war fictions, such as The War in the Air (1908) and The World Set Free (1914).

H.G. Wells soon turned away from his early “scientific romances” toward more “realistic” novels and the (often estranging) world of international politics. But in his wake, an identifiable literary tradition had been established. Wells had taken Verne's popular formula of scientific fiction, modernized its thematic repertoire and its hermeneutic breadth, and had transformed it into a powerful instrument of speculation and social critique. As the twentieth century dawned, this new literature had now earned its lettres de noblesse, but it would still be years before it would receive its permanent genre name of “science fiction.”",,2137949238,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Evans, Arthur B."," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

20. Cultural History (Part II: Theory),"It is a truth universally acknowledged that stories about the future mirror our hopes and fears about life in the present. But many of the most compelling science-fictional visions of the future are actually based on specific philosophies of the past, and careful study of these narrative futures can provide unique insight into historiography itself. This dual recognition is central to the practice of cultural history as it intersects with both sf and sf studies. Sf authors have long created futures by extrapolating from what they believe to be the key social and material forces shaping history. In a similar vein, sf scholars have long used specific theories of the past to make sense of their chosen genre's history. Furthermore, as cultural historians, scholars increasingly read sf texts for what they reveal about the social values and practices of the past, especially as these texts confirm, complicate, and sometimes even directly challenge official pronouncements about these values and practices.

Philosophies of history in sf

Cultural history encompasses interdisciplinary practices spanning the humanities and social sciences. However, it is most closely associated with philosophies of history that emerged at the beginning of the modern era, when the seventeenth-century British philosopher Francis Bacon first allied historiography with scientific practice. Bacon believed that both historians and scientists contributed to the sum of human knowledge by acting as detached observers who used inductive reasoning to explain phenomena ranging from the movement of tides to the ascendancy of kings and queens. Enlightenment ideas about the quantifiable nature of history and the objective historian reached their apex in the work of the nineteenth-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who claimed that human events unfold according to the demands of an eternal Reason. The task of the trained historian was to articulate the progress of Reason through careful study of great political and military leaders. Such ideas were very much part of the nineteenth-century penchant for open-ended political histories that justified Western imperialism.

Hegelian notions of history are also very much part of the oldest, most public face of sf: space opera. They were particularly appealing to American sf authors who grew up on the rhetoric of manifest destiny, especially as it was expressed in the action-adventure dime novels of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Set in a far future where humans have colonized entire galaxies (often by engaging in war with other, usually humanoid, civilizations), American space operas articulated neatly with Hegelian ideas about the modern nation-state. Furthermore, they revolved around larger-than-life action-adventure heroes who, much like Hegel's great men of history, employed both diplomacy and military prowess to advance their empires. These characteristics were most clearly embodied in the stories that American authors wrote for the pulp magazines of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, including E.E. “Doc” Smith's Skylark (1928-34) and Lensman (1934-48) series, Edmond Hamilton's Captain Future tales (1940-4), and Leigh Brackett's Eric John Stark stories (1949-51). They were also central to many of the comic-strip, radio, and film serials of this period, including Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon and Philip Francis Nowlan's Buck Rogers series.

Of course, Hegelian theories of history had a great deal of competition in the modern marketplace of ideas. Perhaps most significantly, British historian and politician Edward Gibbon advanced his own philosophy of history as a cyclic phenomenon in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776-88). Gibbon extrapolates from the particular situation of Rome to propose that all empires will naturally expand when their leaders employ reason and military discipline, and just as naturally fall if such virtues are exchanged for religion and pacifism. Two popular historians, Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee, updated this idea for the twentieth century. Spengler's Decline of the West: perspectives in world history (1919) applied Gibbon's claims about the cyclic nature of empire to the broader concept of civilization, arguing that civilizations fell when they embraced irreligion and mechanism, as he saw happening in the modern West. Toynbee's Study of History (1934-61) more optimistically proposed that “creative minorities” might stop the cyclical decline of civilization by meeting physical and social challenges in novel ways, echoing Gibbon's own hope that educated, rational people could change the rhythms of history itself.

Given that cyclic theories of history, like their linear counterparts, focus on the actions of great politicians and soldiers over the span of centuries, it is hardly surprising that they found their way into the storytelling practices of the early sf community. A Spenglerian concern with the decline of the modern West is apparent in the work of early twentieth-century British authors who saw themselves as citizens of a failing empire. This pessimism was expressed in future-war stories such as Edward Shanks's The People of the Ruins (1920) and Cicely Hamilton's Theodore Savage (1922) as well as Olaf Stapledon's space opera Last and First Men (1930). With the seismic shocks of the Great Depression, the Second World War, and the Cold War, American authors began to think about their own country in similar ways. Spenglerian ideas about the deterministic nature of history shaped A.E. van Vogt's Weapon Shops (1941-3) and Null-A (1945-9) series as well as James Blish's Cities in Flight sequence (1950-62). For the most part, however, American authors relied on the more open-ended philosophies of Gibbon and Toynbee. Isaac Asimov freely acknowledged that the Foundation trilogy (1942-58) was patterned on Gibbon's History, especially as it held forth the hope that a small but rational elite might resist mob rule and prevent the total decline of one civilization before another replaced it. Meanwhile, Toynbeean ideas about creative minorities breaking free of history's cycles were central to Charles Harness's The Paradox Men (1953) and all of Robert A. Heinlein's future-history stories.

While some scholars (and sf authors) turned to linear and cyclic theories of history because they seemed closely allied with the physical sciences, others proposed new ways of thinking about the past based on their interest in the emergent social sciences. Drawing upon new ideas in political economy, the nineteenth-century philosopher Karl Marx argued that the real engines of history were the forces of Capital that produced inegalitarian class relations. Historians who failed to acknowledge how past economic relations conditioned the possibility of action in the present were at best naïve and at worst guilty of an ideological coverup that served the interests of the ruling class. In the 1920s, Marc Bloch, Lucien Febvre, and other scholars associated with the Annales group in France suggested that historians could avoid ideological interpellation by using the tools of anthropology, sociology, and geography to replace broad outlines of political history with detailed pictures of particular places at specific times.

Taken together, these new ways of thinking about the past paved the way for the explosion of interest in underrepresented groups (including workers, women, racial and ethnic minorities, and gays and lesbians) that characterized history writing in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of the historians engaged in these new fields of inquiry focused upon what Annales scholars called l'histoire des mentalités, or the history of values and beliefs as they are expressed throughout culture. To better assess this seemingly intangible new subject material, historians often borrowed techniques from the social sciences, replacing anecdotes with primary resources and individual case studies with broad data sets and statistical interpretations in their research. As such, scholars including E.P. Thompson, Richard Hoggart, and Lenore Davidoff laid the groundwork for cultural history as a unique discipline.

Sf writers interested in the plurality of peoples and cultures have long incorporated similar philosophies of history into their fiction writing. Those who tend toward economic explanations often work in the utopian tradition, where imaginary rational societies are used to demonstrate the irrational workings of their real-world counter-parts. This tradition began at the turn of the twentieth century with stories including H.G. Wells's The World Set Free (1914) and Men Like Gods (1923) in the UK and Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (1888) and Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland (1915) in the US. During the heyday of American magazine sf, economic theories of history were most often expressed in dystopian capitalist satires including Fritz Leiber's The Green Millennium (1953) and Frederik Pohl and C.M. Kornbluth's The Space Merchants (1952). In recent decades American cyberpunk novels including William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy (1984-8), Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash (1991) and The Diamond Age (1995), and Pat Cadigan's Synners (1991) continue the tradition of equating unchecked capitalist relations with dystopian futures. Meanwhile, American author Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars (1992-6) and Science in the Capital (2004-7) trilogies and British author China Miéville's Bas-Lag series (2000-4) extend the projects of their utopian predecessors by imagining how scientists and other rational people might surmount the crises engendered by global capitalism to change the course of history for the better.

Sf authors interested in sociologically and anthropologically based theories of history also tend to work within the utopian narrative tradition. This is particularly apparent in the work of feminist sf writers. For example, Gilman's Herland, Joanna Russ's The Female Man (1975), Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time (1976), and Nicola Griffith's Ammonite (1993) all present readers with egalitarian societies organized around female values that stand in sharp contrast to inegalitarian masculinist counterparts. Conversely, novels such as Suzette Haden Elgin's Native Tongue (1984) and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1985) depict dystopic futures for women extrapolated from the sociobiological discourses and antifeminist rhetoric of the Reagan era. Elements of both utopian and dystopian narrative inform sociological thought-experiments such as Theodore Sturgeon's Venus Plus X (1960) and Ursula K. Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), which use androgynous alien cultures to question dominant cultural assumptions about the supposedly natural gender relations of our own world.

Sf authors also use alternate histories to explore how science and society might evolve outside Western paradigms. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the work of African-American writer Steven Barnes, whose Insh' Allah books (2002-3) imagine an alternate Earth where African people colonize the Americas with the labor of European slaves. In a similar vein, Octavia Butler's Patternist series (1976-84) and Minister Faust's Coyote Kings of the Space Age Bachelor Pad (2004) relate the adventures of psychically gifted black Westerners who learn that they are heir to ancient African struggles between the forces of civilization and chaos. As such, these authors insist that multiple histories might well exist in our own world.

Even as some cultural historians have sought to ally themselves with the social sciences, others have found inspiration in literary theory. Hayden White (1973) argues that historians do not examine facts dispassionately but create meaning by presenting facts via specific narrative genres and literary tropes. Given that this challenges longstanding beliefs about the objectivity of the historian and the transparency of the historical text, it is not surprising that many scholars have rejected White's ideas. But others have seized upon them as a means by which to bolster the legitimacy of alternate historical inquiries and even open new fields of study, including the history of historiography itself.

For nearly half a century writers associated with postmodern sf have raised similar questions about the nature of historical reality in their own writing. Two of the earliest novels to explore these issues were Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle (1962) and Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5 (1969), both of which imagine that the history of the Second World War as we know it is just one possibility among many. In the following decade, stories such as Octavia Butler's Kindred (1979) and William Gibson's “The Gernsback Continuum” (1981) extended this line of inquiry to consider the effects of historical narrative as material reality, suggesting that any attempt to negotiate the past through a single frame of reference can have deadly effects in the present and future. More recently, James Morrow's Towing Jehovah (1994), Robert Charles Wilson's The Chronoliths (2001), and Gwyneth Jones's Life (2004) have explored how world-changing discoveries increase rather than decrease ontological uncertainty, prompting people to multiply the religious, political, and scientific narratives they use to make sense of reality. Slipstream authors also often explore issues of historiography by telling stories that merge the thematic concerns, stylistic techniques, and cognitive effects of seemingly incompatible narrative genres. In doing so, they foreground how specific acts of narrative creation produce meaning and shape our sense of the real. While Geoff Ryman addresses this problem directly in the final chapter of “Was . . .” (1992), most slipstream writers take a more indirect approach. For example, novels including Karen Joy Fowler's Sarah Canary (1991), Michael Cunningham's Specimen Days (2005), and Kathleen Ann Goonan's In War Times (2007) blend history and sf to illuminate the interpenetration of fact and fiction. Meanwhile, many of the stories in Ted Chiang's Stories of Your Life and Others (2002), Kelly Link's Magic for Beginners (2005), and M. Rickert's Map of Dreams (2006) explore how the intrusion of the supernatural into the mundane world might imbue the past and present with new meaning - or how it might shatter meaning altogether.

Philosophies of history in sf studies

Sf is an ideal subject matter for cultural historians because it developed in tandem with modern political, economic, and technoscientific systems. As such, it is a compelling vehicle for the expression of modern social values. Early claims in this vein came from within the sf community, as H.G. Wells in the UK and Hugo Gernsback in the US each argued that the genre provided an ideal way to introduce readers to the sciences and technologies that would shape the next century. More recently, sf has been embraced by the academy as well. Donna Haraway (1985) counts feminist sf authors among the most important cultural theorists of our times, while Fredric Jameson (1991) describes cyberpunk sf as the preeminent literature of late capitalism.

Although claims about the privileged position of sf as cultural expression extend back to the late nineteenth century, sf scholars have only begun to employ the methodologies of cultural history in the past two decades. This can be attributed to the fact that sf scholarship has evolved along much the same lines as historical scholarship itself. In 1958 Thomas Clareson and Edward Lauterbach organized the first panel on sf at the annual Modern Language Association conference. In 1959 Clareson published the first issue of Extrapolation, a journal that aimed to define sf as a self-regulating literary genre through the compilation of bibliographies and histories. Brooks Landon notes that these first scholarly records of the genre were “largely anecdotal” and “infrequently contextualized in the larger culture” (qtd in Luckhurst 2005: 6). As such, they mirrored the traditional historian's penchant for linear narratives based on case studies of great men.

In the 1960s and 1970s, sf scholars began to engage new ideas from elsewhere in the academy. As the social sciences gained ascendancy and radical campus politics led students to demand socially relevant courses of study, scholars responded with new classes that connected sf to everything from literature and history to religion and politics. They also produced new anthologies such as Martin Harry Greenberg and Patricia S. Warrick's Political SF: an introductory reader (1974) and Jack Williamson's Teaching SF: education for tomorrow (1980). Thus sf met the needs of students and scholars alike because it provided concrete examples of the more abstract theses and theories professors advanced in their courses.

The second generation of sf scholars was even more receptive to literary and critical theory, which quickly came to dominate the field and resulted in the creation of the journal Science Fiction Studies in 1973. Broadly speaking, critical theory approaches to sf fall into three categories. As pioneered by Samuel Delany in the late 1960s, poststructuralist sf criticism explores how readers must learn the conventions of the genre to engage with it in meaningful ways. In a more overtly politicized vein, Marxist sf scholarship, most commonly associated with Darko Suvin and the other founding members of Science Fiction Studies, treats sf as a literature of “cognitive estrangement” that extrapolates from current trends in science and society to demonstrate the process of historical change and imagine startling new futures. Taken together, poststructuralist and Marxist approaches demonstrate both how the formal properties of the genre lend themselves to sophisticated critical inquiry and how individual texts can instantiate political and cultural theory. Finally, feminist sf criticism, as first articulated by Joanna Russ in the early 1970s, proposes that the genre's future-forward orientation makes it useful for authors interested in how the relations of science, society, and gender change over time. Like Delany and Suvin, Russ drew upon poststructuralist ideas about textual instability and the production of meaning through language deployment to champion a new kind of sf criticism. But while poststructuralist and Marxist critics focused on the similarities within sf storytelling as a whole, Russ treated feminist writing as part of an oppositional and largely neglected discourse within the patriarchal world of letters. As such, her work recovering women's sf paralleled that of Lenore Davidoff in the realm of feminist social history.

Through the pioneering efforts of writers such as Delany, Suvin, and Russ, sf studies has evolved into a set of transdisciplinary analytic practices centering on what Catherine Belsey calls “history at the level of the signifier” (Belsey 2000: 106). Today, sf scholars who employ the subject matter and methodologies of cultural history challenge what Mark Poster (1997), following Roger Chartier (1988), identifies as the three major distinctions informing traditional liberal arts scholarship: learned versus popular texts, production versus consumption, and reality versus fiction. Traditionally speaking, historians have claimed learned texts and production as their rightful terrain, relegating popular culture and the politics of consumption to their more quantitatively minded counterparts in the social sciences. They also have invoked the distinction between reality and fiction to make sense of their differences from one another. Cultural history emerges when these distinctions erode and scholars examine how different kinds of texts “configure what they point to, and . . . are configured by it” (Poster 1997: 9).

The past two decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in the cultural history of sf as it pertains to everything from the development of nuclear weapons and kitchen technologies to ongoing debates over literary aesthetics and the history of sf history itself. Broadly speaking, these cultural histories build upon prior work in sf studies and can be divided into three types, based on the binary distinction they most clearly challenge. For example, mid-twentieth-century genre scholars including Kingsley Amis, Sam Moskowitz, and Brian Aldiss challenged conventional ideas about learned versus popular texts by defining sf in ways that included everything from Plato's Republic (c. 360 BC) and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818) to the space operas of the pulp era and the New Wave narrative experiments of their own time.

However, it is only recently that scholars have returned to the primary documents generated by sf authors and editors themselves in regards to the matter of aesthetics. For example, Gary Westfahl (1999) examines the writing of Hugo Gernsback and John W. Campbell to show how early sf editors defined the political and aesthetic parameters of their chosen genre. This is very much a transitional work: it focuses on the founding “great men” of the genre and treating its history as something distinct from the rest of culture, and thus reiterating traditional assumptions about the appropriate subject matter of history and the necessary distinction between high and low culture; but simultaneously its use of primary materials and belief that popular forms can be qualitatively analyzed are fundamental to the practice of cultural history. Roger Luckhurst (2005) creates a more fully developed cultural history of sf by examining how early proponents of the genre, including Gernsback and Wells, participated in cultural debates about the meaning and value of modern fiction. Like Westfahl, Luckhurst bases much of his work on primary documents. However, he goes on to situate those documents in the broader context of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century scientific, political, and mainstream literary discourses. Despite their differences, these two cultural histories of sf extend the arguments advanced by earlier genre scholars to show not just how sf may encompass both learned and popular texts, but how members of the sf community have always been participants in the construction of those very terms.

Sf scholars also build upon the work of their predecessors by examining fan activities that blur the line between production and consumption. Camille Bacon-Smith (1992), Henry Jenkins (1992), and Patricia Frazer Lamb and Diane Veith (1986) examined the complex relations of fan writing to sf film and television franchises. More recently, critics have explored how digital technologies affect the shape of fan activity. As Karen Hellekson and Kristina Busse (2006) and Henry Jenkins (2006) demonstrate, the internet has made fan production a public activity that challenges conventional notions of intellectual property. It also provides fans with global forums in which to exert influence over mainstream-media sf itself. Sf scholars are interested in fandom's past as well. For example, Justine Larbalestier (2002) examines the letters pages and editorial columns of early sf magazines to show how the debates over sex, gender, and sf carried out by fans influenced the aesthetic development of the genre as a whole. As Larbalestier demonstrates, fans - like authors and editors - have always played active roles in the creation of sf as a self-regulating genre.

Finally, scholars interested in the relations of sf writing to technoscientific practice produce histories of the genre that complicate conventional ideas about fact versus fiction. The first generation of studies to address this, including Robin Roberts (1993) and Jane Donawerth (1997), explored how women's sf has developed over the course of the past century by revising patriarchal narratives of science and society. Lisa Yaszek (2008) has used the kind of thick description that Belsey associates with cultural history to demonstrate how women's sf responds to specific ideas about science, technology, and gender that emerged after the Second World War and still inform our world today.

Scholars interested in the relations of science, society, and race have used the critical apparatus of cultural history to great effect as well. For example, De Witt Douglas Kilgore (2003) explores how the mid-twentieth-century space race fostered new and more egalitarian (if sometimes naïvely colorblind) discourses of science, technology, and race in science and sf alike. Similarly, the critical essays collected in Jutta Weldes (2003) demonstrate how hopes and fears about life in a post-Enlightenment, multicultural world are expressed through the mutually constitutive discourses of political policy and sf. As Weldes's anthology indicates, cultural histories of sf do more than simply illuminate the past and present. They help us better understand the shape of things to come as well.

Future directions in sf studies as cultural history

Sf lends itself to the critical methodologies of cultural history because it has always been a hybrid form, emerging from gothic and adventure fiction and promising to transform dry scientific fact into pleasing imaginative narrative. Additionally, many members of the sf community are hybrid subjects who occupy multiple roles as authors, editors, and fans. Still others inhabit subject positions outside sf as scientists, technical consultants, and mainstream writers. By treating these individuals as nodes within overlapping discourse networks, we can see how authors sometimes function as cultural historians and how thinking of them as such opens up new areas of inquiry.

Like sf critics, sf authors have long produced texts that complicate conventional ideas about learned versus popular texts. Before the consolidation of genre writing in the early twentieth century, authors including Wells, Bellamy, and Gilman moved easily between the worlds of highbrow and popular literature. Later, both the sf and mainstream literary communities claimed postmodern authors such as Vonnegut, Atwood, and Shirley Jackson as their own. While Jackson always thought of herself as a genre writer, both Vonnegut and Atwood rejected association with the sf community, thereby seeming to shore up the distinction between high and low culture. This situation has reversed itself in recent years, as authors including Michael Chabon, Jonathan Lethem, and Michael Cunningham have embraced dual writing identities and made powerful arguments for the value of sf to mainstream readers. Perhaps not surprisingly, all of these authors have made issues of reading and culture central to their storytelling practices, thereby inviting the cultural historian of sf to consider how their texts and pronouncements on the craft of writing articulate with major aesthetic debates of the past two centuries.

Scholars might also consider how sf authors treat the subject of fan production and consumption in their own writing. For example, in Helen Reid Chase's “Night of Fire” (1952), aliens attack Earth to rid the planet of its aggressive human population. Among the few benign humans who are saved from destruction are housewives who define themselves as sf fans. Elsewhere, Sharyn McCrumb's Bimbos of the Death Sun (1996) relates the tale of an egotistical sf author who is murdered by frustrated fans; in The Faculty (Rodriguez 1998) and Galaxy Quest (Parisot 1999) fan knowledge helps to save the world; and Faust's Coyote Kings of the Space Age Bachelor Pad explores how sf fandom helps two young men survive an ancient African battle between good and evil. A cultural history of stories in this vein would provide unique insight into issues of production and consumption as they pertain to the evolving relation of authors and readers over time.

Finally, sf critics might elaborate on the relation of fact and fiction in sf with cultural histories of sf authors who are also science writers and technical consultants. In the late 1930s L. Taylor Hansen exchanged sf writing for work as a science columnist in Amazing Stories, and in the postwar era dozens of other women made careers by writing both sf and science fact. Today, Robert Silverberg writes a regular science and technology column for Asimov's Magazine, and until early 2007 Pat Murphy worked as a science writer for the San Francisco Exploratorium. Perhaps even more provocatively, scholars might consider the history of authors who have established science careers outside the sf community. Such a history could begin with Gernsback's role as the founding editor of sf, electronics, and sexology magazines and end with a discussion of the Sigma group authors, including Greg Bear, Larry Niven, and Goonan, who critique technoscientific disaster scenarios for the US Department of Homeland Security. Taken together, these kinds of cultural history projects can help us better understand sf as a privileged vehicle of cultural expression.",,2137944624,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Yaszek, Lisa"," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

22. Feminisms (Part II: Theory),"Both the first Western theories of women's rights and the earliest sf by a woman appeared in the seventeenth century. Feminist theory - which provides “intellectual tools by which historical agents can examine the injustices they confront, and can build arguments to support their particular demands for change” (McCann and Kim 2002: 1) - and sf by women have been intimately connected ever since. This chapter outlines some of these connections.

Strictly speaking, there were no feminists until the 1890s: “feminist” entered the English language in 1894 and “feminism” in 1895 (see OED). But scholars regularly extend the term to designate historical debates in Europe and the Americas about the nature of women and the struggle for women's rights. In this sense, feminists in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries defended women against misogynist stereotypes, while later feminists argued first for women's right to education and to preach (sixteenth to nineteenth centuries), then for marriage reform and for women's right to divorce (eighteenth to twentieth centuries), and then for women's right to vote, inherit property, and share ownership in marriage property (from the nineteenth to twentieth centuries). Thus “feminist” does not mean the same thing for all places or historical periods - for example, Middle Eastern women had the right to own property long before Western women. Moreover, there have always been multiple feminisms: Anglo-American women in the nineteenth century who remonstrated for sex education and free love, for example, were quite different feminists from those who argued for woman's enfranchisement based on her essentially moral and motherly nature. Feminist politics and theory have developed through debates as often as through consensus.

The history of feminism and feminist theory is often divided into the categories of First Wave, Second Wave, and either Postfeminist or Third Wave (or sometimes Postmodern or Poststructuralist or Postcolonial or Transgender Feminism). “First Wave” denotes the struggle for women's political rights and suffrage in nineteenth-century Europe and United States (see Sanders 2000). “Second Wave” refers to the political movement beginning in 1960s United States, focusing on critiquing femininity and claiming a woman's right to her own body, connecting to global women's movements, and, some would argue, continuing today (Warhol 1995: 308-14; McCann and Kim 2002: 18). Postfeminism applies to a generation of late 1980s and early 1990s women who rejected the previous generation's goals, and if not entirely rejecting feminism, yet rejected “any definition of women as victims.” (Gamble 2000: 44). “Third Wave,” or Generation X feminism, applies to a generation of 1990s women who have emphasized women's collective political action and global issues (see Stewart 2000). In my view, these arbitrary constructions help people strategically discuss historical differences in approaches to social change involving women, but do not comfortably fit the historic changes in feminist theory or sf by women, or the multiple theories of feminism in our current world. Consequently, this chapter will instead divide the material into five sections that emphasize the historical interconnections between sf and theory.

Women's right to education: 1650-1750

Before the seventeenth century in Europe, feminist theory centered on the controversy about women or the querelle des femmes: in this pamphlet debate, one side charged women with being, by nature, fickle, unchaste, irrational, devoted to gossip, and spending money - in all ways inferior to men; the other side defended women as, by nature, chaste, loyal, hardworking, and superior to men. Seventeenth-century political theories gave the woman issue a new vocabulary: like men, women, too, might have rights, to free speech, or to preach, or to an education. Typical of these debates are the pamphlets by Margaret Fell, Bathsua Makin, and Mary Astell. In Women's Speaking Justified (1666), Fell argues that women had a right to preach because God had created women equal to men spiritually, and because the Bible records a history of women's preaching. In An Essay to Revive the Ancient Education of Gentlewomen (1673), Makin argues that women have a right to an education according to their class status because historically civilized cultures allowed women's education, and because educated women may better help their husbands and children. In A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, Part I (1694), Astell proposes, as did Makin, that women receive a humanist education similar to that of men, but in a woman's monastery or college retired from the world; A Serious Proposal Part II (1697) outlines a detailed program of study in the languages and logic, rhetoric, grammar, and the arts, as well as the means for such an education (women combining their resources). Fell, Makin, and Astell, then, refute the idea that women are naturally inferior to men, seeing them not as less rational by nature, but less educated by custom than men.

Margaret Cavendish's utopian fiction The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing-World (1666) similarly depicts women as capable of rational thought and benefiting from education. Cavendish places her utopia at the North Pole, where an Empress is given “an absolute power to rule and govern all that world as she pleased” (Cavendish 1994: 132), and fills it with technological marvels, including a submarine. The Empress summons philosophers and scientists to her court to educate her and to speculate on the nature of science, religion, and government. She further decides how best to teach women, instituting “a congregation of women”; since women “generally had quick wits, subtle conceptions, clear understandings, and solid judgments,” they soon become learned theologians (Cavendish 1994: 162). The Empress further appoints a female scribe, the fictional character Margaret Cavendish, and teaches her how to make a utopian world through her imagination in her writings. Thus, in this early period, most feminist theory and the one instance of an sf text by a woman emphasize women's right to an education.

Essentially female: 1850-1920

While the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century political struggle for women's rights focused on property rights, sexuality, and enfranchisement, feminist theory generally founded arguments for these rights on a gendered sphere of interests and an essentially different female nature. For example, Lucretia Mott's 1849 oration, “Discourse on Woman,” begins by arguing for women's right to preach, based on women's spiritual equality with men and a biblical history of women's preaching, and concludes by extending her argument to other rights: while women are different from men by nature, she accedes, nevertheless there is no need to overstate those differences, since women also possess intelligence. Consequently, women, who currently possess only the right to petition, in justice should be granted all the civil rights of men, especially suffrage and property rights during marriage. In “Womanhood a Vital Element in the Regeneration and Progress of a Race” (1886), Anna Julia Cooper argues that the reverence and respect for women originating with Christianity needs to be developed into full equality because women are the major influence in racial uplift, since they are by nature the first influence on children; consequently, in African-American advancement, women's education needs a special place. Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Women and Economics (1898) argues that just as the natural characteristics of men and women were unnaturally developed through the extreme division of labor allotted them, humans might evolve further by socializing the housekeeping duties that distracted women from intellectual development and thus, through generations, women would come to equal men in actuality as in potential. Thus all these feminist arguments for women's rights were based on women's essential difference from men, although Gilman thought that women could evolve to be similar to men.

Feminist technological utopias of the period similarly emphasized the essentially different nature of women by constructing all-women utopias as models for a better society. Mary E. Bradley Lane's Mizora: a prophecy (1880-1) imagined a technological paradise utilizing gas stoves, washing machines, and airships, where all men and women of color had died off when white women took over the government to end war, and where children were produced by parthenogenesis, and teaching and housework were viewed as scientific professions. Gilman's Herland (1915) imagined a society where women are governors, doctors, scientists, and educators, and where human life is bettered by exercise, vegetarianism, abstinence from sex, genetic experimentation with plants, scientifically organized education, and conflict resolution by discussion.

Similarly, early twentieth-century socialist feminist theory influenced feminist utopias, such as Lilith Lorraine's “Into the 28th Century” (1930), published in the US pulps (see Enns and Sinacore 2001: 473; Donawerth 1990), and women's anti-war activism influenced the development of the housewife hero of mid-century sf by women (see Yaszek 2004).

Healing the middle-class housewife: 1950-1975

In the 1950s and 1960s, feminist theory came in bestseller form. Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique (1963) revealed to millions of readers the “nameless dissatisfaction” of the “happy housewife heroine” (Friedan 1984: 33) confined to “The Comfortable Concentration Camp” (Friedan 1984: 282) of the middle-class home. Friedan contrasted women who had fruitfully returned to work with unhappy women who were raising increasingly alienated children. Kate Millett's Sexual Politics (1969) exposed the techniques of patriarchal oppression - male chivalry, female rivalry - and argued that men and women were educated into different cultures. She analyzed the misogynist literature of the twentieth century, uncovering the dominance games of canonical male modernists. Germaine Greer argued that ours is a woman-hating society, in which a man killing the woman he loves is considered romance (Greer 1970: 204), and urged women to throw “the baggage of paternalistic society” overboard and to choose “self-determination” or “womanpower” (Greer 1970: 119). Shulamith Firestone's The Dialectic of Sex: the case for feminist revolution (1970) laid out the repressive economics of twentieth-century reproduction (women do all the labor of childbearing and much of the labor of childrearing but they are not paid or valued for it) and argued for reproductive technologies to relieve women of this labor. Phyllis Chesler revealed one institutional means of female oppression in modern America: many women were committed to institutions by their husbands because they were not doing their jobs as housewives, or by their doctors who saw them as asocially resisting feminine roles. Worse, Chesler concluded, “Women who succeed at suicide are, tragically, outwitting or rejecting their 'feminine' role, and at the only price possible: their death” (Chesler 1972: 49).

In this climate, women sf writers produced critiques of housewife oppression and studies of women driven mad by patriarchy. For example, Pamela Zoline's “The Heat Death of the Universe” (1967) intersperses the mundane tasks of an ordinary housewife with the laws of thermodynamics, the scientific warnings that the universe always returns to disorder, and we follow the protagonist through a housewife's routine, her rejection of that role, and a spectacular breakdown. Other notable stories featuring women liberated from the housewife's prison include James Tiptree Jr's “The Women Men Don't See” (1973), in which a mother and daughter run away with aliens so as to escape the stifling confines of earthmen's patriarchy, and Carol Emshwiller's “The Start of the End of the World” (1981), in which housewives, oppressed by their human husbands, help aliens take over the world, and then also rebel against the aliens. Joanna Russ's angry, satirical We Who Are About To . . . (1977) exposes the patriarchal myths that generate sf conventions. After the narrator kills off the men who would force her back into female servitude in order to colonize the distant planet onto which they have crash-landed, the second half of the novel documents her lyrical descent into hallucinatory madness, where the narrator achieves a kind of freedom, discarding the remaining, inner constraints of patriarchy.

Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time (1976), extremely influential in the 1970s feminist movement as both theory and sf, expressed women's anger at the constraints of feminine roles and their fears of the institutions men used to punish women who resisted those roles. Protagonist Connie Ramos lives in two worlds: in one, she is a poor Latina on welfare who has lost her daughter to Child Services and who cannot get a job, a world in which her anger at the unfair system around her sees her committed to an asylum by male doctors; in the other, a feminist utopia, property is communal, babies are gestated in artificial wombs, and men and women are truly equal - in jobs, status, opportunity, childcare, and housework. The novel ends with an act of war: Connie tries to protect the Earth's future by poisoning the doctors who experiment with drugs and surgery to eradicate resistance. Piercy's acknowledgments thank, among others, Phyllis Chesler.

Recovering women's history: 1970-1995

The 1970s saw the development of Women's Studies as a field and the exponential growth of women's history and recovery of female-authored literary texts. In 1979, an edition of Gilman's Herland connected the early 1970s experiments by feminist sf writers to earlier roots in women's writing, and so resurrected the genre of the feminist utopia. Important as part of the rediscovery of women's literature (and therefore evidence of the patriarchal erasure of women's history), soon the feminist utopia also became a way of working out in narrative form central issues of 1970s and 1980s feminism. Herland was followed by republication of many other nineteenthand twentieth-century feminist utopias, and by contemporary portrayals of idealized all-female communities. Besides the recovery of earlier feminist utopias, which usually fantasized communities of middle-class white women, the growth of African-American Studies precipitated a republication of slave narratives that helped to recover knowledge about nineteenth-century black women's lives. This scholarship also influenced sf by women, not only by introducing the slave narrative as a template for sf writers, but also by providing models for black female characters.

The 1970s and 1980s, then, saw a plethora of feminist utopias. In Joanna Russ's The Female Man (1975), an inventive division of the point of view into multiple women - Janet, Jeanne, Joanna, and Jael - allows Russ to contrast the future of women without change (low-paying jobs, hoping to marry a man you do not hate) with a dystopian future where the sexes are literally at war, and a utopian future where men have disappeared and women can do everything. In Sally Miller Gearhart's The Wanderground (1979), nature has rebelled against men's rape of the environment and has sided with women. Men live only in cities because nature decrees that neither machines nor phalluses work beyond the suburbs. Women rule in the country, developing a society based on goddess worship, healing rituals, and communal action. A critique of such radical lesbian utopias is offered by Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Ruins of Isis (1978), Pamela Sargent's The Shore of Women (1986), and Sherri Tepper's The Gate to Women's Country (1988). Others continued with the form of the feminist utopia, adapting it to include multiple sexualities: Ursula K. Le Guin's Always Coming Home (1985), and Joan Slonczewski's A Door into Ocean (1986). Yet others debated the possibility of such utopian visions through feminist dystopias: Suzette Haden Elgin's Native Tongue (1984), and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1985).

From the 1960s on, slave narratives were recovered in important numbers, including numerous editions of Frederick Douglass's autobiographies, The Life of John Thompson, a Fugitive Slave (1968), A Narrative of the Life of Rev. Noah Davis (1969), and Six Women's Slave Narratives (1988), edited by William Andrews. Especially influential was the theoretical framework that Angela Davis supplied for rethinking the roles of women under slavery. She analyzed the ways in which slavery denied black women the feminine role of their white counterparts, but also reviewed the history of the resistance of black slave women, pointing to the heroic attempts of the black woman “to ensure the survival of her people” (Davis 1971: 5). By analogy to the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century accounts of slavery, hope, and escape, which were used to condemn the evils of slavery (dehumanized violence, rape of black women, casual cruelty, disruption of the family), women sf writers adapted the slave narrative form to imagined worlds where women, white or black, redefined heroism as survival and sometimes escaped enslavement. Most important was Octavia E. Butler's Kindred (1979), set in both 1976 Los Angeles and in 1830s and 1840s Maryland. Dana, a writer and part-time office worker, is repeatedly drawn through time to the plantation of her ancestors where she must save the life of Rufus, the white master, in order to make sure that the black slave woman impregnated by him produces the child whose descendants eventually birth Dana. In this complicated story, Dana both cares for and despises Rufus, and gradually sheds her contempt for slaves who did not attempt escape as she experiences all the oppressions that kept them enslaved: denial of literacy, whipping, patrollers, tracking dogs, and betrayal by other slaves. Kindred merges the sf time-travel novel with the slave narrative to trace the ways in which Dana is literally marked by her ancestors' slave history, and depicts as heroic both the survival tactics and the violent resistance that the slaves enact.

Many other feminist science fictions draw on the slave narrative. Suzy McKee Charnas's Walk to the End of the World (1974) literalizes women's servant status in a future California and depicts a rebellion in which women break free, killing their male masters and escaping to freedom. In Cecelia Holland's Floating Worlds (1975), a brown anarchist enslaved by a patriarchal alien race eventually tricks her masters into giving her back the Earth that has now been nearly destroyed by their wars. In Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Shattered Chain (1976), Darkover Amazons, living outside the patriarchal society, help to rescue a woman enslaved by the Drytowners. And in Ursula K. Le Guin's “A Woman's Liberation,” from Four Ways to Forgiveness (1995), a woman raised as a slave on a plantation journeys to another planet in order to be free, only to realize that there she must still wage another struggle in order to have equal rights as a woman.

Postmodern, postcolonial, transgender: 1980-2005

Postmodernism, with its denial of any natural or essential self, called earlier feminist theories of gender into question. Gayle Rubin (1975) delineated a more complicated “sex/gender system,” following which feminists began to recognize gender as unnatural and constructed, not inherent, and to theorize diversity at the levels of subjectivity, sexuality, and society. For example, bell hooks explores the intersections of black women's oppression as black, as women, and as working class, and exposes ways that colonizers distort reality so that the colonized accept myths about themselves (e.g., the Mammy figure; see hooks 1981: 81-4). hooks (1984) further destructs the myth that women share a common oppression (hooks 1984: 44), and argues for taking difference as a basis for solidarity (hooks 1984: 64-5). In a series of essays, Patricia Hill Collins developed the standpoint theory of the 1980s (a woman has multiple allegiances and so multiple political identities) into a theory of the interlocking matrix of identity for women. Collins (1989) distills political principles from the concrete experiences of working black women. In a commentary on science, Collins (1999) advocates feminist analysis depending on “intersectionality,” examining the intersections of science, gender, race, ethnicity - all in their historical moment.

From the 1980s onwards, feminist theorists also offered alternative models for conceiving of difference as part of subjectivity: the cyborg, the hybrid, the androgyne, the transvestite. In an essay first published in 1985, “A Manifesto for Cyborgs,” Donna Haraway argues that we live in a postmodern society where all are cyborgs, and that we should begin dreaming a monstrous world that is postgender. To Haraway, the cyborg, the sf part-human/part-machine fantasy that is rapidly becoming our reality, represents “transgressed boundaries” (Haraway 1991: 154) and unsettles the concept of heterosexuality as natural (Haraway 1991: 150). The cyborg, untouched by nostalgia for past innocence (Haraway 1991: 151), suggests the possibility of moving beyond the old limits of male and female into a new world of human-machine-animals (Haraway 1991: 173) and “partial identities” (Haraway 1991: 154). Cherríe Moraga proposes future women as hybrid, mixed-blood, acknowledging their kinship with animals as well as humans who are racially different (Moraga 1993: 112-31). Judith Butler argues that “gender is a kind of persistent impersonation that passes as the real” (Butler 1990: viii), that it is always performative, constituting itself (Butler 1990: 25), not an attribute of a person, but a relation between persons (Butler 1990: 10). Like Haraway and Moraga, Butler argues that identity is fragmented, each person possessing multiple identifications that congregate to form a complex identity (Butler 1990: 67, 76). Because gender is created through “repeated stylization of the body” (Butler 1990: 33), parody, dissonance, proliferation of gender identities, and getting gender “wrong” are all means of political opposition to the constraints of gender (Butler 1990: 31, 140-1). Rather than calling on women's identity for a new politics, as did the utopian feminism of the 1970s, Butler argues for a politics that contests all gender and identity (Butler 1990: 5). Thus, for Butler, the androgyne represents the new order of gender, confusing and redistributing the elements of gender so that it transgresses and challenges categories (Butler 1990: 100-1). Marjorie Garber presents cross-dressing as an “enabling fantasy” of “blurred gender” (Garber 1992: 6), a third sex that destabilizes gender by exposing it as “artifact” (Garber 1992: 249).

The concepts of the androgyne, the hybrid, the cyborg, the transvestite, partial identities, and the performative nature of gender are crucial to the developments of sf by women during the last three decades of the twentieth century. Tanith Lee's Drinking Sapphire Wine (1977), for instance, offers a tale where all teenagers are androgynous, not in one body, but in multiple bodies. In this future society of domed cities, robots have assumed medical and police functions, and so when a person dies, the robots quickly transport the person to a facility that provides a new body, often one picked out ahead of time by the person. Thus teens change bodies and sexes casually, and perform both male and female sexuality, and with partners who started out as the same sex. What is gender in this future world if everyone has been a different gender at some time? When Hatta pursues the narrator out of love, he wears the romantic poet body that the narrator had worn just before her last change. When they first make love, Hatta asks, “Was I as good as you were when you were me?” (Lee 1977: 152). Gendered terms are inadequate to describe this experience, and so suggest the androgynous, fragmented identity that postmodern and transgender theory ascribes to all gender categories.

Melissa Scott's Dreaming Metal (1995), a story about the development of the first robot with artificial intelligence (AI), offers a fantasy of the postgender world described by Haraway. While the planet Persephone is still racist, pitting upper-class Yanquis against lower-class Coolies, this future world is not gendered beyond the use of “he” and “she.” There are male and female haulers and pilots, weavers and merchants, computer engineers and theater managers, entertainers and musicians. Scott further offers names that are not gendered - we cannot tell, from their names, whether pilot Reverdy Jian, manga artist Chaandi, or musician Fanning Jones are male or female. And attire, mostly loose pants and shirts, also suggests a postgender world. But Scott further unsettles the concept of gender. The first AI, Celeste, is part of the act of Celinde Fortune, a magician; Celeste's body of metal is modeled on Celinde's female form - but what gender can be assigned to an artificial construct? The replication forces the audience to acknowledge the degree to which Celinde's own femaleness is performed rather than innate. In addition, many of Scott's characters are cyborgs: Reverdy Jian has machine eyes and is “wired” to connect with her spaceship's computer and controls, while Celinde Fortune is “wired” to merge with the computers that run the theater and her apartment. These humans, married to their machines, further transgress and challenge gender categories. As the plot unfolds, many of the characters are depicted in lesbian or gay relationships - Reverdy and Chaandi (both women); Celinde and Muthana (both women); and Red and Vaughan (both men). In this future cyborg world, heterosexuality is not the norm, and gender is a construct that has lost its current hyper-significance.

Nalo Hopkinson's Midnight Robber (2000) combines several of the liminal figures of postmodern feminism. Tan-Tan, born in a technological utopia on the colonial world Toussaint, settled by immigrants from Jamaica (“Raino Carib and Arawak; African; Asian; India; even the Euro” (Hopkinson 2000: 18)), follows her exiled father into the other-dimensional world that shadows Toussaint. In this alternate world, instead of the luxurious care of the Granny-Nanny (an artificial intelligence planted in humans as nanomites), Tan-Tan works hard with other settlers and suffers the abuse of her stepmother and her father, eventually his raping of her. She kills her father, escapes into the wilderness with one of the douen, the bird-like natives of the planet whose females, larger than males, can fly, and in the wilderness learns truly how to live in her postcolonial world. As Tan-Tan grows up, she becomes a legend, a transvestite Robber Queen who plays carnival tricks for justice on human villagers. Befriended by a young douen, reunited with her true love, Tan-Tan eventually gives birth to a new people: the Granny-Nanny has found her across dimensions and created her son a cyborg, with nanny-powers woven into his DNA. She names him “Tubman,” to celebrate her freedom.

There are many such science fictions by women with androgynous or cyborg characters resisting contemporary gender categories. In Anne McCaffrey's The Ship Who Sang (1969) and its many sequels, Helva, flying cyborg (a female brain in a spaceship body), saves worlds and lends emotional support to suffering humans. The female ship captain in C.J. Cherryh's The Pride of Chanur (1982), from a lion-like race, swashbuckles in pirate dress with gathered pants, boots, and rings in her ears. Emma Bull's Bone Dance (1991) follows the story of an androgynous protagonist who takes on the gender that best suits the surroundings.

Conclusion

Feminist sf writers have themselves contributed to the development of literary theory that incorporates sf and gender. Russ called on women to give up the restricting myths of male and female literature and turn to sf, where stories of exploring new worlds, of creating needed social machinery, and of evaluating technology are “not stories about men qua Man and women qua Woman” but “myths of human intelligence and . . . adaptability” (Russ 1972: 18). Similarly, Le Guin analyzed the position of women in sf as grouped with depictions of working-class and nonwhite peoples as inferior (Le Guin 1979: 99). Le Guin called on sf writers to rewrite the genre to include The Other, remembering that “53 percent of the Brotherhood of Man is the Sisterhood of Woman” (Le Guin 1979: 100).

Feminist sf criticism has traced many connections between feminist theory and sf by women. Natalie Rosinsky deploys the theory of literature as defamiliarization, arguing that speculative fiction by women estranges the audience “from conventional reality” so that readers “question biases inherent in any dominant world-view” (Rosinsky 1984: 114). Sarah Lefanu examines the “subversive” strategies that women writers of sf use to explore “the myriad ways in which we are constructed as women” (Lefanu 1988: 5). Marleen Barr reveals the theoretical import of sf fiction by women as “feminist fabulation” that “rewrites patriarchal myth” through “revisionary power fantasies for women” (Barr 1992: xxvii, 3). Robin Roberts argues that sf “can teach us to rethink traditional, patriarchal notions about science, reproduction, and gender” (Roberts 1993: 2). Jenny Wolmark categorizes sf as postmodern literature because it displays the contradictions of institutional discourses, especially gender discourses, and opens them to renegotiation (Wolmark 1994: 3). Jane Donawerth (1997) traces the affiliations between feminist science theory and sf by women and connects contemporary theorizations of cross-dressing to the male narrator of women sf writers.

24. Marxism (Part II: Theory),"The Marxist interest in and connection to sf is longstanding and well known, but also highly complex, uneven, and mediated. Like its counterparts in feminist, postcolonial, queer, and ethnic literary and cultural theory, Marxist theory is always connected in both spirit and practice to objectives that range beyond a specific literary text, and thus employs cultural analysis in the interests of social and political praxis. The first and longest section of this chapter will outline fundamental Marxist theoretical concepts and concerns with relation to sf; the second identifies representative theorists and studies; the third surveys some significant sf works of fiction and film that have been of interest to Marxist critics.

Marxist cultural theory and practice

The particular “flavor” of Marxist criticism of cultural production is distinguished by several key concepts that theorize the historically specific material articulations of production and consumption. The mode of production refers to the differing economic systems which in turn generate specific forms of social relations out of which unique forms of cultural production arise. Of the four (possibly five) modes identified by Marx, capitalism is the most relevant to discussion of sf because of the specific development of science, technology, and economics from the early nineteenth century to the present time. Capitalism is characterized by the ways in which the surplus value of labor is captured as profit by the owners of the means of production, resulting in a lopsided distribution of material assets. Three effects are especially noteworthy. Alienation results from the facts that workers often cannot afford the very goods and services they create, nor do they own the resources needed for production. The irresolvable material antagonisms existing between capitalist haves and proletarian have-nots result in class struggle, which is replicated in the content and especially the forms of cultural practices, as exemplified by such categories as “popular culture” and “high art.” The third effect, reification, describes the practice of equating human relationships with relations among things. This component is most readily understood via attention to commodification (i.e., the social valorization of consumption), which is especially characterized by the commodity fetish. The latter refers to the ideological mystification of imagining that things have “a life of their own” rather than being the products of human labor.

Tying all of these concepts together in Marxist criticism are two basic methodological practices. The first, historicization, insists that only by the analysis of practices at specific moments in cultures can one grasp their meaning and significance. In this insistence, Marxism vehemently challenges the prevailing bourgeois idealist theory of interpretation which separates “true art” from “popular culture,” and characterizes the former as bearing transcendent, universal value. The second is critical thinking, which reflects upon its own premises, insists upon supporting evidence, and recognizes the complexities of ideology generated by the mode of production's particular social relations.

With these basic terms in mind, we can turn first to how Marxist critics apply them to the analysis of cultural production in general, and then move on to their particular applications with respect to sf. This chapter examines two main concerns of Marxist cultural theory: the appearance and development of specific forms of production; and ideology critique, i.e., how the particular cultural work expresses or resists the ideological mechanisms and assumptions of the status quo

Georg Lukács's The Theory of the Novel (1916), while not specifically Marxist, is arguably among the first important and purely theoretical works of the early twentieth century devoted to close analysis of cultural, in this case literary, production. Lukács established the basis for linking particular forms of fiction, such as realism, to specific historical eras, and demonstrated the possibilities for sophisticated theoretical analysis of culture. Subsequent historicizing studies by others refined the connections of period to form but also demonstrated how culture production variously replicates or challenges ideology. The Frankfurt School critics T.W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer identified, in Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), what they termed the emerging “culture industry” - forms of mass-cultural production such as film and music which simultaneously generated profits for capitalists while also inculcating uncritical political and social passivity. Countering this overly reductive position, Raymond Williams, especially in Culture and Society, 1780-1950 (1960), established the basis for what became known as Cultural Materialism by arguing for the resistive and even liberatory possibilities of mass culture. Also contributing sophisticated materialist theoretical models for interpreting cultural production during the post-Second World War period were critics such as Roland Barthes (Writing Degree Zero (1953), Mythologies (1957)), Louis Althusser (For Marx (1965), Reading Capital (1968)), and especially Pierre Machery (A Theory of Literary Production (1966)). While almost no Marxist cultural critics appeared in the repressive Cold War culture of the US, Fredric Jameson and Darko Suvin must certainly be noted. We will return to their specific contributions to sf criticism, but must here highlight Jameson's The Political Unconscious (1981) and Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (1991), which offered fresh strategies for historicizing cultural production in relation to the stages of capitalism over the past two centuries. As this brief survey indicates - many more theorists and works could be mentioned - Marxist theorization of cultural production had achieved an impressive sophistication by the turn of the millennium.

Marxist criticism and sf

Marxist sf criticism emerged alongside academic teaching and writing about sf in the late 1950s, which saw the launch of the first scholarly journal dedicated to sf, Extrapolation, in 1959. In this context, Raymond Williams's “Science Fiction” (1956) is possibly the first specifically Marxist sf essay. This short but pioneering ideological critique calls attention to the significance of sf and offers guidelines on how it might be productively interpreted from a Marxist perspective. These twin axes have, in various forms, become axiomatic. Concomitant with the rise of “New Wave” sf in the 1960s is a noticeable increase in sf criticism, as indicated by the founding of the Science Fiction Research Association in 1970. But the seminal development in Marxist sf criticism is the emergence of Science Fiction Studies (SFS) in 1973. Though the journal has always published essays from a variety of perspectives, it nevertheless validated and provided a venue for academic Marxist interpretation of sf and championed sf as important for Marxist analysis.

Attention in the 1970s and 1980s focused on two topics: defining sf as a form and discerning its relationship to utopian theory. Darko Suvin (1979) had immediate and longstanding influence on sf criticism due to its Marxist-Structuralist insistence on historical specificity, analysis of form, and attention to utopian dynamics. Suvin, one of the founding editors of SFS, offered an influential definition of the form: “a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition, and whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative [i.e., the novum] to the author's empirical environment” (Suvin 1979: 7-8; emphasis in original). His hyper-specific definition has by no means gone unchallenged, but gains great interest when historicized in its own right as an attempt to validate sf as a credible “literary” genre. Also notable from 1979 is Patrick Parrinder's unduly neglected Science Fiction: its criticism and teaching, which contributed to the debate about form by insisting upon sf's nonsynchronous generic development.

Suvin's definition has generated wide discussion, especially among Marxist scholars. Carl Freedman accepts Suvin's model as “not only fundamentally sound but indispensable” (Freedman 2000: 17), but modifies it “to emphasize the dialectical character of genre and the centrality of the cognition effect” (Freedman 2000:23). Freedman further argues that dialectical estrangement is not merely the limiting condition of sf but a “precondition for the constitution of fictionality - and even of representation itself” (Freedman 2000: 21). Challenging Suvin (and Freedman) are China Miéville and Mark Bould's essays in an issue of Historical Materialism (2002) dedicated to “Marxism and Fantasy.” Miéville insists that sf and fantasy, far from being separate formal categories (the latter of which Marxists have traditionally denigrated as reactionary), both create “a mental space - redefining - or pretending to redefine - the impossible” (Miéville 2002: 44). Bould likewise argues for shared continuities between sf and fantasy such that so-called generic differences of “various types. . . of fantastic text” are better understood “as a further process of product differentiation” (Bould 2002: 81).

Arguing from a specifically Marxist perspective, Suvin also epitomized the relationship between utopia and sf in terms of the former being “the sociopolitical subgenre” of the latter (Suvin 1979: 61; emphasis in original). Thus his and Peter Fitting's many essays on the subject, Tom Moylan's important theorization of the “critical utopia” in Demand the Impossible (1986), Jameson's wide-ranging Archaeologies of the Future (2005), and Philip Wegner's Imaginary Communities (2002) must be recognized here as specifically Marxist critiques of utopian sf.

Conventions of form have also received attention from Marxist critics. Adam Roberts's Science Fiction, perhaps the most pointedly Marxist sf textbook yet to appear, offers a compelling argument for the “alterity of machines” (Roberts 2000: 148) as linking sf iconography - such as the spaceship and the robot - to the origin and development of commodification as outlined in Marx's Capital, especially respecting matters of desire and power (Roberts 2000: 150). Also drawing upon Marx, Rob Latham's Consuming Youth (2002) theorizes the metaphorical importance of vampires and cyborgs to signify the complexities and contradictions of youth consumer culture.

Thematic developments within sf have generated corresponding critical attention by Marxist-influenced critics to such issues as subjectivity, imperialism, and gender. Scott Bukatman's Terminal Identity (1993) explores the “crisis” of postmodern subjectivity; while John Rieder writes compellingly on imperialism in sf in Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction (2008), as does Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr in his SFS essay “Science Fiction and Empire” (2003). The relationship of Marxist to feminist interests is well exemplified by Donna Haraway, whose widely cited “Manifesto for Cyborgs” asserts fidelity “to feminism, socialism, and materialism” (Haraway 1991: 149) by contending that sf depictions of cyborgs correspond to wholly new “dangerous possibilities” of identity (Haraway 1991: 154). Calling upon examples from authors such as Vonda McIntyre, Octavia Butler, and Anne McCaffrey, Haraway argues that cyborg alterity challenges current models of identity, especially those of women, grounded in patriarchal capitalism. The cyborg, by contrast, “has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seductions to organic wholeness . . . [or any] higher unity” (Haraway 1991: 150).

Arguably the most productive and influential Marxist sf critic since the early 1970s, however, is Jameson. No summary can address the range of his interests. His essays on such authors as Philip K. Dick, Ursula K. Le Guin, McIntyre, Kim Stanley Robinson, and William Gibson, focusing on such topics as utopian theory, globalization, postmodernism, class struggle, and generic historicity, are collected in Archaeologies of the Future. The collection continues Jameson's longstanding and perhaps most important theoretical contribution, that of cognitive mapping as a strategy for historicizing and grasping the otherwise unrepresentable operations and effects of multinational capitalism. Properly understood as a demystifying countermeasure to the debilitating operations of ideology, “achieved cognitive mapping” is the process of conceptualizing an intellectual form which can grasp “the totality of social relations on a global. . . scale” (Jameson 2000: 283). Jameson regularly asserts that sf in general is precisely such a privileged representational apparatus, and in particular that Gibson's Pattern Recognition (2003) “sends back more reliable information about the contemporary than an exhausted realism” and thus maps “the new geopolitical Imaginary” (Jameson 2005: 384-5).

Thus Marxist theory, far from fading in the post-Soviet era, has become ever more pertinent, being the best-suited conceptual model for grasping the rapid developments of the capitalist world order and the imminent off-world extensions that loom in humanity's future.

Marxism in sf, or, “Left-sf”

All sf cultural production represents social, economic, and political effects that naturally arise as a result of scientific and technical extrapolation. The engagement of such issues varies widely, of course, from ostensibly minor details of setting, character, and plot to the most intense foregrounding of utopian agendas, but utopian thought and political theory in the broader sense do not automatically equate to Left-sf thematics. In fact, much sf simply assumes as given or aggressively advocates the expansion of capitalism. This section therefore will offer (1) a selective historical overview of Left-sf cultural production that is not ostensibly utopian yet features antior post-capitalist critique; (2) commentary concerning some special examples; and (3) an attempt to historicize overall trends. In general but with some notable exceptions, the North American tradition offers few examples of Left-sf, though it does evince a long history of more generalized anti-capitalist critique. In contrast, European sf carries on a sustained dialogue with socialist and even Marxist concerns.

Late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Western sf, in a world reeling from technological advancements, industrial capitalism, and the rise of proletarian movements, shared with other fictions (e.g., Theodore Dreiser's Sister Carrie (1900), Frank Norris's McTeague (1899)) a pointed interest in social issues. The publication of Samuel Butler's Erewhon (1872), Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (1888), and other socialistically minded examples of utopian fiction set precedents for the conflation of utopian fiction and “scientific romance” traditions as they emerged in the work of the first clearly programmatic sf author, H.G. Wells. From The Time Machine (1895) and When the Sleeper Wakes (1899) onward, his sf often explored socialistic themes, albeit in conflicted ways. As Suvin argues, “Wells' SF works are clearly 'ideological fables,' yet he is a virtuoso in having it ideologically both ways. His satisfaction at the destruction of the false bourgeois idyll is matched by his horror at the alien forces destroying it” (Suvin 1979: 217). Wells's clearest socialist views were expressed in his non-sf, purely utopian, and even nonfiction works, such as A Modern Utopia (1905) and Men Like Gods (1923). His contemporary Jack London's The Iron Heel (1908) depicts, in more pointedly utopian-fictional form, the grim dystopian effects of oligarchic capitalism, and is committed to Marxist communism to an extent seldom equaled.

Subsequent political developments, repressive of proletarian movements in the US and to a lesser extent in Western Europe, altered the artistic climate with respect to Left-sf in the years following the First World War and the Russian Revolutions. The specifically American and reactionary “pulp” era of the 1930s held such sway that, aside from George S. Schuyler's satiric commentary on American racism, Black No More (1931), no notable examples of American Left-sf appeared until the 1940s, and even those subsequently appearing in the 1950s are few and far between. Left-sf flourished in Europe, however.

As might, with hindsight, be expected, Russia generated considerable sf activity, with 25 works appearing before 1917 and at least 155 during the years 1920-7 (Suvin 1979: 26). Especially significant was Nikolai Chernyshevsky's popular What is to be Done? (written 1862; published 1905). A seminal contribution to Russian utopian socialist thought, particularly with respect to women's rights, its model of personal freedom was emulated in much Russian sf and utopian fiction. Alexander Bogdanov-Malinovsky's Red Star (1908) depicts a scientifically advanced and successful socialist society on Mars and served to inspire like-minded sf authors, such as Kim Stanley Robinson. Also writing in the glow of the post-October Revolution is Alexei Tolstoy, whose sf novels, Aelita (1922, revised 1937) and Engineer Garin's Death-Ray (four versions, 1926-37), were popular for decades in Russia but seldom read in the West. Yevgeny Zamyatin's important but conflicted We (written 1920, published in English 1924) interrogates the pernicious effects of mindless socialistic scientism but importantly has no sympathy for capitalism. The novel has long been interpreted in the West as an attack upon the communist experiment, but, as Suvin, Moylan, and Jameson have argued, this novel should be read not as “anti-utopian” but as a “critical dystopia” that advocates “a vision common to Anarchism and libertarian Marxism” (Suvin 1979: 257).

Following the innovative decade of the 1920s, Russian sf stagnated until after 1956, when a “second [though short] great age of Russian SF” emerged (Suvin 1979: 265). This era produced what is perhaps the greatest example of Russian socialist sf and utopian fiction, rivaled only by What is to be Done? in terms of historical importance, Ivan Yefremov's monumental Andromeda: a space-age tale (1957), which touches virtually every issue relevant to socialist concerns, from science to the arts to ethics and beyond, and engages Western sf “in a well-informed polemical dialogue” (Suvin 1979: 268). The “Yefremov era,” according to Suvin, lasted only into the 1960s, at which time Russian and other Warsaw Pact sf lost its utopian, socialist impulse and turned sharply satirical.

Returning to the West, we find that the interwar period produced few noteworthy examples of left-leaning sf. One line of British sf reacted fearfully to the promise of the technological future: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) bitterly denigrates technical development, a key dimension of socialist societies, instead stressing an argument in favor of liberal humanist aesthetics that serves to disguise the novel's fundamental reactionary political perspective. However, another form of British sf, identified by Roger Luckhurst as “evolutionary sf,” carried on Wells's interest in progressive social issues, exemplified by Olaf Stapledon's Star Maker (1937). In the US during the late 1930s, at least two general and loosely aligned factions of sf appeared in opposition to the school of right-wing hard sf identified with the pulp tradition of Gernsback and Campbell. The first, exemplified by E.E. “Doc” Smith's Lensman stories in Astounding during the late 1930s, insists that sf alone is able to combine fabulation and critical thinking, resulting in a presumably more sophisticated and progressive form of fiction. Despite these attributes and claims to the contrary, the Smith branch of sf's ostensible liberal commitment to cosmic awe is in the final accounting nothing short of an elitist mentality in full complicity with capital's ideological agenda. The other line emerging just before the Second World War was advocated by the Futurians, a loose grouping based in New York, not all of whom were sf writers, which included socialists of several stripes and even some communists. Some went on to various degrees of success, the most notable being Isaac Asimov, Frederik Pohl, Judith Merril, Donald Wollheim, C.M. Kornbluth, and Damon Knight. Despite Knight's claim that the socially minded Futurians had a “mighty mission” (Knight 1977: 15) to educate sf fans respective to the Futurian agenda as grounded in the spirit of 1930s socialism, as Luckhurst notes, they in fact did not produce a mature “left-liberal critique . . . until the post-war era” (Luckhurst 2005: 68). By the time the youthful Futurians began to produce something approaching Left-sf, however, the contentious but still relatively heady days of 1930s political experimentation had given way to the fearful realities of the atomic bomb, growing uneasiness with rampant consumerism, and the political repercussions of the hard-line anti-communistic milieu of the 1950s HUAC and McCarthy period.

Socialist thought in United States Left-sf varies from considerably muted to non-existent during the 1950s and nearly all of the 1960s. Sf, along with much other cultural production of the Cold War era, certainly satirizes or questions gray-flannel-suit conformism, creeping bureaucracy, commodification, and even nascent environmentalism, but it rarely poses solid political questions or offers Left alternatives to capitalism. Perhaps only Heinlein's Double Star (1956) can be said to be manifestly political, though in a libertarian and accordingly nonsocialistic sense. Important examples of satirical critique without alternatives include Ray Bradbury's nostalgic The Martian Chronicles (1950), Kurt Vonnegut Jr's Player Piano (1952), Alfred Bester's vigorously caustic The Stars My Destination (1956), Harlan Ellison's short fiction of the 1960s, and Frank Herbert's richly complex Dune (1965). More focused but still fuzzy examples appeared from the maturing Futurians, such as former Trotskyite Merril's groundbreaking feminist sf “That Only a Mother” (1949) and Shadow on the Hearth (1950), Pohl's short fiction, such as “Tunnel under the World” (1954) and his important collaboration with Kornbluth, The Space Merchants (1953), and Theodore Sturgeon's More Than Human (1953). Not coincidentally, Merril wrote the “Introduction” for Path into the Unknown: the best of Soviet sf (1968). Additionally, Dick's early short fiction that is likewise critical of consumerism, such as “Sales Pitch” (1953) and “Paycheck” (1954), bears strong affinities to the themes and narrative strategies of Futurian fiction. Still, despite John Clute's claim that Pohl and Kornbluth in the 1950s “were on the cutting edge of social comment” (Clute 1995: 182), with the exception of Sturgeon's utopian Venus Plus X (1960), virtually no genuinely Left-sf was published in North America during the 1960s. (Zenna Henderson's important but overlooked Pilgrimage (1961) must be passed over in this context since her alien utopian commune, despite its many progressive features, arises out of mystical spirituality rather than dialectical materialism.)

Critique of the capitalist status quo in Left-sf found new impetus in the wake of the Vietnam War and the increasing effects of global capitalism in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, but throughout the 1950s and 1960s hegemonic sf, while toying with social critique, was often implicitly and sometimes even overtly anti-socialist and even rightwing libertarian, as evidenced in stories by authors such as Jack Vance and Heinlein. Sf in this period far more often focuses on, variously, the possible negative and often apocalyptic future (e.g., Walter M. Miller Jr's A Canticle for Leibowitz (1960)) or the uncritical celebration of “science and technology” as if they somehow manifest an independent existence free from inherent economic and political concerns (in Heinlein, again, and even Asimov). American Left-sf once again emerged in the form of the New Wave, in part related to and supported by public interest in related progressive concerns, such as the anti-war, civil rights, women's, and ecological movements. Some important authors, while offering very different visions, include Roger Zelazny (Nine Princes in Amber (1970)), Samuel R. Delany (especially Triton (1976) and the tour-de-force Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand (1984)), and Ursula K. Le Guin (The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), The Lathe of Heaven (1971)). These works foregrounded vaguely socialist concerns in the areas of human freedom and dignity, and offered variations of post-capitalist social visions, though to be sure Le Guin and her contemporaries Joanna Russ and Marge Piercy are better known for their mid-1970s utopian fiction.

By the mid-1980s, however, most American sf production in any form of print, television, or film had long since abandoned even the pretence of leftist thought except in the work of the newly appeared Kim Stanley Robinson. Demonstrating a clear commitment to intelligent and sustained Left ideals, Robinson's Three Californias trilogy, beginning with The Wild Shore (1984), initiates an extended meditation on capitalism's future and beyond to post-capitalist societies, a focus Robinson carried on into the 1990s with the important Mars trilogy. Also in the 1980s, the new cyberpunk movement registered the profound shifts taking place in the development of what Ernst Mandel terms “late capitalism” - the impact of communications technology made possible by satellites, computers, and the internet; the surging importance of biomedical technologies; and the growing consolidation of financial transactions under transnational, global corporations. Exemplary works in this form include William Gibson's Neuromancer (1984), Bruce Sterling's Islands in the Net (1988), and Pat Cadigan's Synners (1991), which feature intense and unsympathetic critiques of capitalism's expanding sphere of influence and its often sinister relationship to technology. In no important way, however, can these works be called Left-sf, although Sterling's Holy Fire (1996) is regrettably underappreciated despite its thoughtful socialist meditation on life-extension and healthcare.

From the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, some modestly Left-sf by women appeared in the US. Sheri Tepper's The Gate to Women's Country (1988) presents a feminist Left vision that critiques the relationship of militarism and misogyny, while Octavia E. Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy, beginning with Dawn (1987), and her later Parable series, initiated by Parable of the Sower (1993), grapple with racism, xenophobia, sexism, and religious fanaticism. While Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1985) explores similar themes, Butler's more complete Left-sf vision emphasizes the rebuilding process for society in ways that resonate with socialist views of material equality and personal freedom, especially in the post-capitalist social order represented in The Parable of the Talents (1998).

American television and film during the 1980s and into the 1990s, increasingly grounded within the corporate commodity apparatus of capitalism, generated almost nothing in the way of Left-sf. The vast majority of sf films were dystopian cautionary tales (the Terminator franchise (1984-)), feel-good humanistic fables (E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)) or reactionary romps, such as the trendsetting Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope (1977). A few notable exceptions include the socialist-feminist alternative future depicted in Lizzie Borden's Born in Flames (1983), the scathing indictment of capitalism in Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop (1987), and John Sayles's critique of capitalist racism in The Brother from Another Planet (1984).

The towering American Left-sf achievement published during the 1990s was Robinson's Mars trilogy, consisting of Red Mars (1992), Green Mars (1993), and Blue Mars (1996). Supremely optimistic, yet grounded in the awareness that genuine change is both slow and painful, this series raises the standards of Left-sf to new levels of commitment and sophistication by engaging in a sustained and non-idealist post-capitalist meditation. The trilogy vividly renders Marx's prediction for the potential of human freedom once released from material-based class struggle, and its triumphal conclusion depicts humanity carrying a socialist vision to worlds beyond our solar system.

British sf over the past four decades often engaged with socialist and even Marxist thematics, which may be said to begin with Michael Moorcock's assumption of the editorship of New Worlds in 1964. Encouraging the pursuit of experimental and radical social critique in sf, he published what would in due course become an impressive generation of Left-sf authors and their followers, including Brian Aldiss and J.G. Ballard. Taking William Burroughs as their literary inspiration, this New Wave evinced a latent Left position (that is, advocating Left views of consciousness but not highlighting the requisite socioeconomic components). A second wave, however, depicted manifestly Left extrapolations: Iain M. Banks's Culture novels, such as Consider Phlebas (1987), offer an extended post-scarcity, Left socio-techno vision; Ken MacLeod actively engages Marxist ideas in the Fall Revolution Quartet, beginning with The Star Fraction (1995); and China Miéville's remarkable and generically innovative Bas-Lag series incorporates an extended meditation on Left political and social issues, most clearly in Iron Council (2004).

Of special and final note is the work of two recent women authors. Tricia Sullivan's Maul (2003) vigorously interrogates social and political issues in her depiction of a near-future, but non-utopian, world administered solely by women. Also important is Gwyneth Jones's Bold as Love (2001), and the ensuing namesake series - Castles Made of Sand (2002), Midnight Lamp (2003), Band of Gypsys (2005), and Rainbow Bridge (2006). Jones's near-future depiction of the UK, originally sketched out in a 1992 short story, grapples with gender, political, economic, social, and environmental issues emerging from the breakdown of the capitalist status quo and the resulting revolutionary possibilities. The novel sequence aggressively challenges the reactionary dystopian bent of much sf by presenting a plausible utopian vision grounded on Left-based values emphasizing shared resources and decision-making. Jones's work thus stands as one of the most important contemporary works of Left-sf.

25. Nuclear Criticism (Part II: Theory),"What is nuclear criticism?

While literary and cultural studies often introduce undergraduates to critical theory (e.g., Marxism, linguistics, feminism, psychoanalysis), the nuclear criticism of the 1980s and early 1990s is typically absent from the curriculum and the introductory anthologies such courses assign. Undoubtedly, this is partly a result of shifts in the institutional and political contexts within which it emerged. By the mid-1990s, the criticism that took the end of the world as its subject found that the Earth was still standing; and other political questions, such as the continuing evolution of global capitalism, made its ethical imperative seem less pressing.

Broadly speaking, nuclear critics were concerned with “the applicability of the human potentiality for nuclear self-destruction to the study of human cultural myths, structures, and artefacts” (Scheick 1990: 4), and in particular with critical theory's engagement with the threat of nuclear extinction. In the mid-1980s, as critical theory consolidated its position in Western academic institutions, nuclear critics published a series of manifestos, editorials, and articles in special issues of the journals Diacritics (1984), Science Fiction Studies (1986), and PLL: Papers on Language & Literature (1990). Simultaneously, popular cultural depictions of nuclear apocalypse and post-apocalyptic dystopias appeared in significant numbers, including novels (David Brin's The Postman (1985), Whitley Strieber and James W. Kunetka's Warday and the Journey Onward (1984)), films (The Terminator (Cameron 1984), Def-Con 4 (Donovan 1985)), television movies (The Day After (Meyer 1983), Threads (Jackson 1984)), and comics (the 25-part Judge Dredd “Apocalypse War” story in 2000 A.D. (1982)). This currency provided nuclear criticism, envisaged as a contribution to nuclear disarmament, with a sense of urgency and importance.

Reflecting on this meeting between theory and extinction, these journals suggested six broad avenues of critique. First, how has conceptualizing nuclear war as “just another” apocalypse - imagining it, for example, as an heir to biblical apocalypses, as in Walter M. Miller Jr's A Canticle for Leibowitz (1959) - flavored its understanding and perhaps acceptance by policy makers and the public? Second, how might literary interpretation - by disentangling the rhetoric and postures of the arms race, deterrence, and “nukespeak” - illuminate the superpowers' nuclear proliferation? For Daniel L. Zins, literary study of nonliterary nuclear texts makes “a significant contribution to the continuity of human life” by working to “demystify and deconstruct those national security texts and discourses that keep us in thralldom to the nuclear deity” (Zins 1990: 36). Third, how has terror surrounding nuclear war entered the psychological climate, shaping individual psyches, and in what ways is it discernible in cultural productions? H. Bruce Franklin observed the “psychological numbing” (Franklin 1986: 115) of the nuclear era, his vocabulary indicating the massive influence of Robert J. Lifton's research into the psychical survival mechanisms triggered by the nuclear threat. “Numbness” is one such mechanism, a psychological skin preventing the traumatic possibility of nuclear war entering one's consciousness. Lifton argues that the nuclear threat has been “domesticated” for most people, fading into the background of everyday life. Nuclear weapons exist because of this tolerance, and it can be shattered - and nuclear weapons rejected - if numbing is transcended (Lifton 1979: 7; Lifton and Falk 1982: 102-10). This activist sensibility - to consolidate public awareness and mobilize opposition to the nuclear threat - underpinned much nuclear criticism. Looking for psychological explanations of the arms race and its drive toward extermination, some critics turned to psychoanalytical theory (Fornari 1974). As early as 1949, Aldous Huxley's Ape and Essence anticipates the construction of nuclear weapons and the perverse “fear of the War we don't want and yet do everything we can to bring about” (Huxley 1966: 37).

Fourth, many nuclear critics used gender to critique the nuclear arms race, often drawing on psychoanalytical language. In some instances, this reproduced a polarized “battle of the sexes”: “On one side are mostly men who make policy decisions and invent the vocabulary of arms talk. On the other are frequently women leading men against installations, with figures and scenarios for anti-nuclear struggle taken from the vocabulary of [feminism]” (Anon. 1984: 3). In Helen Caldicott's Missile Envy (1984), women “are generally born with strong feelings for . . . the preservation of life,” whereas men “enjoy killing” and are “more psychologically aggressive than women” (Caldicott 1984: 294-5); nuclear weapons are “a symptom of several male emotions: inadequate sexuality and a need to continually prove their virility plus a primitive fascination with killing” (Caldicott 1984: 297).

Caldicott's position typifies the concept of sexual difference advocated by the Women's Peace Movement in the 1980s (see Freeman 1989). This entrenchment in nature absents male voices from anti-nuclear protest, erases the historicity of gendered identities and nuclear deterrence, and perpetuates inequality by rooting conflict between the genders in antagonistic, mutually exclusive biological differences. An alternative feminist interrogation of the nuclear threat de-emphasized biology, offering instead a cultural critique of masculine supremacism. Suggesting that societies threatening to use nuclear weapons are organized around “the phallocentric concept that power, success, peace and safety depend on the literal domination of all life as we know it” (Schweninger 1991: 178), these critics argued that the nuclear “arms race is rooted in the values of a male supremacist culture, particularly its promotion of a domineering phallic sexuality” (Caputi 1991: 66).

This is certainly the framework through which many critics have understood Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Kubrick 1964), in which the men operating America's nuclear defenses are subject to an aberrant desire, a strange love, whereby nuclear destruction overlaps with and ultimately displaces sexual desire. Since radioactivity would make the Earth's surface unlivable, military scientist Dr Strangelove is titillated by the prospect of living in an underground bunker populated with ten females (selected for “sexual characteristics” of a “highly stimulating nature”) for every male, and with nothing to do but breed so as to repopulate the planet. Major Kong inventories his survival kit, which includes prophylactics, lipstick, and nylon stockings with which to sexually exploit female survivors of the apocalypse, and he straddles a nuclear bomb as it falls to its target. The attack on the USSR is ordered by General Jack D. Ripper, whose name links serial sex murder and the arms race as extreme manifestations of the phallic sexuality underpinning male supremacist culture (see Linden 1978: 64-6). Ripper “finds his ultimate satisfaction in violent assault,” although his “mutilation sex murder takes the form of an all-out nuclear attack” (Caputi 1991: 67). (Other important gender critiques include Mars-Jones 1990 and Tarantelli 1986.)

A fifth critical activity related nuclear weapons to knowledge-production and the role of technology in Western culture. Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947) exposed the contradiction shadowing the application of Enlightenment reasoning and the spread of scientific knowledge: the greater the technology that humankind develops to emancipate itself from natural limits, the greater destructive power it possesses to inflict upon itself. As Ape and Essence taunted, humankind's “much touted technology . . . raises our standard of living, [but] increases the probability of our violently dying” (Huxley 1966: 37). Finally, some nuclear critics connected nuclear maneuvering to military and strategic history. Paul Virilio stressed the importance of the relationship between war, speed, technology, and visualization. The mid-twentieth-century advent of strategic bombing and nuclear weapons saw the distance between battlefield and safe, spectating positions contract to a vanishing point: “everything is now brought home to the cities . . . Nuclear deterrence means that there are no longer strictly 'foreign wars'” (Virilio 1989: 66). For Virilio, the experience of war in the atomic age has become less real, since this kind of long-distance warfare enables soldiers to forget about the casualties on the other side, at the same time that images of war are detached from their immediate spatial context: “the concept of reality is always the first victim of war” (Virilio 1989: 33).

Nuclear criticism and poststructuralism

Nuclear criticism's most significant works arose from poststructuralist theory's encounter with the system of deterrence, with nuclear criticism sometimes seen as a mutation of poststructuralism produced by the nuclear threat's ethical immediacy (Scheick 1990: 5). Poststructuralist critics' interest in the possibility of nuclear extinction is unsurprising. Poststructuralism, an intellectual tendency in the humanities and social sciences from the 1970s onwards, sought to show how Western philosophy's metaphysical categories - good, evil, love, death - do not have referents in universal aspects of human life, but are historically constituted through repetition and languageuse. For example, deconstruction, a poststructuralist interpretative strategy, argues that a word's meaning is predicated on the interconnected concepts of “difference” and “deferral”: meaning is produced by absence as much as presence (Derrida 1987: 26-9). Nuclear extinction represented an ultimate absence which constituted the end of the species while also erasing itself as an event by removing all witnesses; death was thus both imminent and always deferred. Nuclear war was always present since the superpowers were ready to launch their missiles the second the opposing side launched theirs; but it was also absent, since it had not started yet. Deterrence itself - the “other” side will not initiate a first strike because our superior nuclear arms ensure our eventual victory, and in this way peace is preserved - was built on a paradox because the superpowers could not simultaneously possess a greater nuclear arsenal than the other (see McCanles 1984).

Poststructuralist nuclear criticism highlighted how semiotic systems struggle to contain ambiguities in the communication process, investigating the system of nuclear deterrence as a series of texts in which slips, dual meanings, and paradoxes are immensely important, while several cultural texts of the period - Threads, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (Miller and Ogilvie 1985), Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker (1980) - documented the breakdown of language and communication after nuclear war. Deconstructionism argues that the gaps and fissures in a text make it impossible to fix and fully understand its meaning. The author does not fill the text with meaning which is carried to the discerning reader without spilling a drop; rather, meanings continually slip away from attempts to pin them conclusively to the text (see Derrida 1987: 28-9). Riddley Walker's linguistic experimentation embodies the mutability of language that deconstructionists foreground (see Schwenger 1992).

The eponymous Riddley lives in a southeast England rendered unrecognizable by nuclear war. Out of the broken language spoken in this post-apocalyptic world, multiple readings of the foundational myth of his society - The Eusa Story - are possible. Eusa, the protagonist, could specifically be the West (Europe and the USA) or Everyman (“You, sir”). The Eusa Story simultaneously retells the crucifixion of Christ, Adam's Original Sin, and the splitting of the atom. At its centre is the confrontation between Eusa and “the Littl Shynin Man the Addom”: “Eusa wuz pulin on the Littl Mans owt stretcht arms . . . He wuz ded. Pult in 2 lyk he wuz a chikken” (Hoban 1998: 31-2). Later, the novel confirms this is an enactment of Christ's crucifixion - “that crucified Saviour . . . thats our Littl Shyning Man him as got pult in 2 by Eusa” (Hoban 1998: 128) - as well as a parable about splitting the atom: “Owt uv thay 2 peaces uv the Littl Shynin Man the Addom thayr cum shyningnes in wayvs in spredin circles . . . Eusa seen the Littl 1 goin roun & roun insyd the Big 1 & the Big 1 humin roun insyd the Littl 1” (Hoban 1998: 32). This seems to be a verbal approximation to particles circulating around a nucleus, the symbol often used for atomic energy. How is this discovery applied? “Eusa put the 1 Big 1 in barms then him & Mr Clevver droppit so much barms thay kilt as menne uv thear oan as thay kilt enemes” (Hoban 1998: 33). Thus nuclear annihilation is traced back and attributed to Eusa's primal encounter with the Littl Shyning Man the Addom. The latter's name, suggesting the biblical Fall of Adam (see Branscomb 1991), provides a further layer of interpretation, especially because The Eusa Story unfolds in the “Hart uv the Wud” (Hoban 1998: 31), a location Hoban aligns with the violent drives behind it: “wud: Means wood as in forest; also 'would', intention, volition or desire . . . The heart of the would is also the essence of one's wanting, the heart of one's deepest desire” (Hoban 1998: 235). Eusa's deepest desires (tearing the Littl Man in two and splitting the atom) are violent and destructive, the legacy of Adam's Fall, and just as inescapably, Eusa cannot be free of the “Littl Shyning Man the Addom,” who tells him “yul jus fyn me in a nuther plays” (Hoban 1998: 35).

In Riddley Walker, the English language has split open, leaving multiple meanings to circulate as it evolves into a phonetic spelling which blocks quick consumption and alienates the reader from immediate understanding. Working meaning out of the text is a demanding, (re)constructive process, forcing the reader to follow many possible interpretations simultaneously, while the post-apocalyptic decay of language in this and other sf texts recalls that our everyday communications are riddled with gaps and haunted by the ruins of former meanings.

The origins of nuclear criticism

The superpowers had possessed atomic weapons since the 1940s, and by the end of the 1950s were capable of annihilating each other. In this early Cold War period many significant cultural critics engage with the nuclear threat: Norman Mailer (1961) wrote on the psychic fallout of possible extinction on America's young, and Susan Sontag (1965, collected 1966) critiqued the giant, irradiated monsters of Hollywood B-Movies for inadequately addressing the enormity of the nuclear threat. The Cold War cooled during the late 1960s and much of the 1970s, but the election of President Reagan in 1980 saw a renewal of US belligerence, partly as a reaction against the perception of America's dwindling position in the world (defeat in Vietnam, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the toppling of the US-sympathetic Shah of Iran). Claiming vulnerability to Soviet attack, Reagan raised military spending by 50 percent (Weart 1988: 377-8). Consequently, the first half of the 1980s represented a high-point of nuclear anxiety, with the idea that human life would be eradicated by nuclear war circulating through Western media more widely than before. The reignited Cold War was an obvious factor in nuclear criticism's emergence: the threat of absolute destruction was a philosophical “state” demanding theorization.

Nuclear criticism was also made possible by cultural shifts in American higher education. J. Fisher Solomon observes that the initial embrace of poststructuralism by American academics in the late 1960s and 1970s took literary criticism into apolitical territory, concentrating on deferred meaning in the literary or historical text, but failing to reach through close reading of texts to the politics of the history that produced them (Solomon 1988: 12-14). A decade later, American critics were beginning to absorb the work of Fredric Jameson and Edward Said, whose writing incorporated, but moved beyond, poststructuralist textual analysis, “blending a Nietzschean distrust of historical dialectics and referential realism with a Marxian attentiveness to the social forces behind the writing of both literary and critical texts” (Solomon 1988: 14) and bringing under scrutiny the unified bourgeois self whose presence had obstructed the full extension of Marxist, feminist, and postcolonial politics into literary and cultural studies. With “geopolitical tensions rising and with American theorists increasingly exploring a new political agenda of their own for post-structural criticism,” nuclear criticism seemed an inevitable development (Solomon 1988: 15). Solomon identifies a colloquium at Cornell University's Department of Romance Studies in spring 1984 (which formed the basis of the special issue of Diacritics later that year) as nuclear criticism's foundational moment of self-consciousness. As poststructuralism was placed in the service of radical politics, the anti-nuclear movement seemed an obvious and necessary bedfellow. This historical and political contingency may be one factor in nuclear criticism's disappearance.

De(con)structing texts

One of the papers delivered at Cornell was Derrida's “NO APOCALYPSE, NOT NOW (full speed ahead, seven missiles, seven missives),” which in its published form is the canonical text of nuclear criticism. Crystallizing poststructuralism's interest in nuclear extinction, Derrida claimed that “deconstruction . . . belongs to the nuclear age” and acknowledged an incapacity to theorize nuclear war, an event unseen in human history: one is “blind and deaf alongside the unheard-of” (Derrida 1984: 27, 21). Deconstruction, attending not to an Author's Work but to matrices of texts informing one another, finds in nuclear weaponry a system of warfare more textual than its predecessors. Nuclear weaponry depends “upon structures of information and communication, structures of language, including non-vocalizable language, structures of codes and graphic decoding” (Derrida 1984: 23). During Derrida's discussion, President “Reagan” acquires quotation marks, perhaps to alert us to the Authorless nature of nuclear war: the origins of nuclear conflict will be overdetermined by the straitjacket of deterrence diplomacy, missile detection systems, and computer science. The pretence of nuclear war as a “fable” enabling diplomatic and strategic leverage may not be identical to the “reality” of nuclear war, but the two are inseparable, influencing and impacting upon each other (Derrida 1984: 23-6). The “real” war must coexist with the “fable,” because the fable alone, although always with recourse to the referent of real war, makes postures of nuclear aggression meaningful on the level of international politics (Derrida 1984: 24, 28). This slippage between the projection of nuclear war, and its absent (because irreducibly “unknown” (Derrida 1984: 21)) referent is closely intertwined with deconstruction's critique of language, whereby a word is not a label signifying a preexisting category. Rather, signified meaning is determined through its historical juxtaposition with other words, and so meaning - as with the threatened absence of nuclear war - is never “simply present or absent” (Derrida 1987: 26).

For Derrida, two conditions permit literary production: the “stockpiling” of “literature” beyond culture's “traditional oral base” - a literary canon embodied in material print texts - and its socio-legal parameters, “implying authors' rights . . . the distinction between the original and the copy, the original and the plagiarized version, and so forth” (Derrida 1984: 26). What is unique about nuclear war is “the possibility of an irreversible destruction, leaving no traces, of the juridico-literary archive - that is, total destruction of the basis of literature and criticism” (Derrida 1984: 26). This dilemma about literature's material “precariousness” (Derrida 1984: 27) prompts Derrida to interrogate its ontological status. Deconstruction's playfulness with supposedly sacrosanct literary works reflects nuclear war's rebuke to literature's immutable, eternal qualities: “The hypothesis of this total destruction watches over deconstruction, it guides its footsteps” (Derrida 1984: 27). It is “in the light” of the hypothesis of total destruction that we come to “recognize . . . the characteristic structures and historicity of the discourses, strategies, texts, or institutions to be deconstructed” (Derrida 1984: 27). Literature's sudden vulnerability compromises its claims to make a timeless address to its readers.

Derrida suggests that nuclear extinction resists being constituted as a teleological conclusion to human history because it would erase the sentient witnesses required to give it meaning. It testifies to “an absolute self-destructibility without apocalypse, without revelation of its own truth, without absolute knowledge,” with our nuclear epoch a suspended judgment on the “end of history” (Derrida 1984: 27). Deconstruction similarly defers a decision on literature's valued cultural position: “the structural possibilities of what goes by the name literature . . . is not limited to the events already known under this name” (Derrida 1984: 27). With nuclear destruction posing the dissolution of literature's single, essential, and timeless meaning, deconstruction seduces the reader into a polygamous relationship with the text (as seen in the multiplicity of meaning at work in Riddley Walker). This is a “relationless relation,” because the “ultimate” determinant of nuclear war is “unsymbolizable, even unsignifiable,” effacing itself as a referent (Derrida 1984: 28). Nuclear extinction permits the proliferation of deconstructive literature and literary criticism but cannot be identified as the force determining the play of textual meaning because it is experienced only as absence. (Work building on the insights of Derrida and other early nuclear critics includes Bull 1995, Chaloupka 1992, and Schwenger 1986.)

Following Alan Nadel (1995), nuclear criticism's resistance to single, fixed meanings is not only a consequence of the Cold War, but a critique of its rhetoric. The multiplicity of textual possibilities released can be seen, in their very existence, to rally against the pursuit of monolithic meaning characterizing competition between the US and the USSR. Each superpower deployed nuclear weapons to defend its continuing existence, weapons threatening the nonexistence of the other bloc. The superpowers' monological interpretation of human relations, unable to recognize their reciprocal relationship with opposing political ideologies, effaced possible alternatives through Mutually Assured Destruction. For some Cold Warriors, nonexistence was preferable to surrender: “Better dead than Red” (see Evans 1998:118). The pleasures of indulging the multiple meanings of texts, however, make their own case for thinking beyond the war of opposing idioms: “Better read than dead.”

Whatever happened to nuclear criticism?

The collapse of the USSR in the early 1990s concluded the Cold War. With the nuclear threat apparently diminished, nuclear criticism's justification as an intellectual intervention on the side of human survival was lessened. When anti-nuclear activism declined outside higher education, it disappeared within. However, the idea that criticism might marry theory and the protection of life on Earth did not evaporate. Ecocriticism - literary and cultural studies' engagement with environmentalism - has appeared since nuclear criticism's disappearance, and is institutionally established in crucial forms that eluded nuclear criticism (dedicated journals such as the online ISLE: Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment, anthologies such as Glotfelty and Fromm (1996), courses on degree programs). In advocating an interpretative practice allied to the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the preservation of life - all life - on the planet, one in which anti-nuclear activism still has a role, ecocriticism may be nuclear criticism's successor, not least in terms of its emergence in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

This explanation of nuclear criticism's disappearance is, however, incomplete. First, works of nuclear criticism continued appearing after the USSR's collapse. Second, despite moves toward disarmament in the early 1990s, the US and Russia still possess enormous nuclear stockpiles. Third, the number of nuclear powers has grown since nuclear criticism's demise. Perhaps this last point illustrates why nuclear criticism's entry into theory's history books is premature. Arguably, nuclear extinction is no longer feared as humanity's fate, but the question of who is entitled to possess nuclear weapons is becoming a defining issue of twenty-first-century politics. During the 1990s, films such as Under Siege (Davis 1992), True Lies (Cameron 1994), and The Peacemaker (Leder 1997) exploited the theft and detonation of nuclear materials as suitably thrilling narrative matter. In Tomorrow Never Dies (Spottiswoode 1997), James Bond recognizes ex-Soviet nuclear torpedoes at a “Terrorist Arms Bazaar on the Russian border” just as a Royal Navy missile strike is ordered on this “terrorist supermarket,” providing all the ingredients necessary for a rousing action sequence in which he must steal the jet carrying the torpedoes and fly it to safety before the missile arrives, preventing a radioactive disaster.

Since 9/11, policing the movement of nuclear technology has grown more prominent in popular culture, and was used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq. If the underpinnings of nuclear criticism - a radical poststructuralism and the threat of nuclear extinction - are no longer as profound in the twenty-first century, theorizing cultural texts in the light of contemporary nuclear politics remains relevant. In seasons two, four and six of the television series 24 (2001-), counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer races against time to stop Islamist terrorists from either detonating nuclear bombs on American soil or attacking US nuclear power plants. 24's repeated depiction of the Middle East as a generator of Islamist extremists, combined with its legitimization of extreme and absolute actions (including torture and murder) against potential nuclear terrorists, arguably positions it as the popular cultural arm of US foreign policy, justifying unilateral actions taken to safeguard national security, regardless of civilian casualties or human rights abuses (see ŽiŽek 2006). While psychoanalysis, Marxism, poststructuralism, and feminism were the theoretical currents that nourished 1980s nuclear criticism, theories of postcolonialism may reenergize it now the issue of nuclear weapons turned against the West is a recurrent feature of our headlines.",,2137947651,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Williams, Paul"," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

26. Postcolonialism (Part II: Theory),"There is no single period or moment marking the emergence of postcolonial approaches to sf, but rather a gradual and intermittent convergence of their concerns which can best be thought of in terms of a growing space of encounter and change, of active translation and transition in the margins between cultures. The meeting of cultural forms which are in these liminal spaces produces new, hybrid identities, “neither the one nor the other” (Bhabha 1994: 25), and both sf and postcolonialism are altered in this encounter.

Postcolonialism is a collection of critical practices that examine the colonial process, the struggle for independence by former colonies, and their creation of distinct national identities. The cultural forms produced by these nations challenge the Western-centric focus of the literary canon and academic scholarship. Postcolonialism is not a coherent body of theory; it is characterized by fundamental disputes that question its own construction and legitimacy. First, the period implied by “post” is contested. It suggests an opposition to, and an end to, colonial rule, but it is also a backwards-looking perspective tying theories and practices to colonialism's ongoing legacy. The focus of postcolonialism is also disputed: should it include only those countries that were former colonies, or also incorporate settler colonies, diasporic and migrant populations, and descendants of people affected by colonial oppression? Its purpose and political stance are also debated: is it merely a Western scholarly exercise, or a means for active political resistance? Leela Gandhi (1998) shows how postcolonialism emerged from an uneasy negotiation of Marxist and poststructuralist positions, shifting between materialist opposition to colonial oppressions and discursive deconstruction of the language which naturalizes such oppressions. Finally, the ability to create national identities through cultural production is questioned: do these cultural forms always refer back to the colonial center, or are they new perspectives in their own right?

Edward Said (1978), commonly regarded as the catalyst for postcolonialism, exposes how the Occident creates the Orient as a category and object of study, providing the ideology for the Occident's imperial expansion. Said demonstrates how the Self creates the Other based on its own needs and desires. However, this maintains a rigid binary, with the Self subjugating the always-victimized Other, an assumption disputed by anti-colonial nationalists. Frantz Fanon (1965) analyzes the ambiguous, symbiotic power relationships between colonizer and colonized, showing how they can be a means of resistance, and examines what is necessary to build a political movement for decolonization. Bhabha and others expand the debate by focusing on transnational, diasporic identities, showing how the colonial encounter leads to the transformation and dislocation of both colonizer and colonized.

Anti-colonial resistance partly relies on forming a homogenous national identity; this ignores and marginalizes parts of the population. Some feminist critics highlight this double colonization of the Third World Woman. However, Chandra Talpade Mohanty (1988) criticizes Western liberal feminism's tendency to characterize the “Third World Woman” as a monolithic and singular entity. Trinh T. Minh-Ha (1989) argues that the celebration of native women is often a means of creating an exotic cultural commodity. Gayatri Spivak (1994) deconstructs the assumption that Western postcolonial and feminist critics can recover and represent the authentic “voice” of the Third World Woman.

Postcolonialism interrogates the complex Self/Other power relationships created by the colonial encounter. Sf imagines encounters with the Other (the alien, the strange newness brought about by change), typically from the perspective of the dominant Self. It perpetuates images of pioneering spaceship crews landing on other planets and exterminating bug-eyed aliens, but also questions and undermines the supposed manifest destiny of space exploration and the oppression of the Other as alien. This chapter will look at the spaces shared by sf and postcolonialism, highlighting the reading and writing strategies which have developed there. It will show how post-colonialism enables a nuanced examination of sf's complicity in and criticism of colonial discourses, and how sf provides ways of imagining futures that counter the argument that postcolonialism looks backward to the imperial center and colonial past.

Charting sf's generic and historical connection to colonialism

Dunja M. Mohr (2005) charts how sf's colonial themes developed in early space operas, which reveled in the prospect of expanding new frontiers in outer space. While L. Ron Hubbard's ruthless Return to Tomorrow (1954) suggests the genocide of all alien races so as to ensure human supremacy, novels from the late 1950s onwards were more critical of the oppression inherent in expansionist attitudes (Mohr cites Robert Silverberg's Invaders from Earth (1958) and Ursula K. Le Guin's The Word for World is Forest (1972)). This approach shows the variety of sf representations of colonialism. However, treating colonization only as a theme suggests that it is a self-contained “given” of sf, like the iconic spaceship or robot, and does not question or explain the connection between colonization and sf.

John Rieder sees the theme of colonization as a symptom of sf's historical roots and its formation as a genre which “appeared predominantly in those countries that were involved in colonial and imperialist projects” (Rieder 2005: 375). Rather than merely transposing colonization into different times and spaces, sf is a form of writing which “addresses itself to the fantastic basis of colonial practice” (Rieder 2005: 376). The European colonial project was an ideological “fantasy” that enabled colonizers to justify their subjugation of colonized people by denying that they were fully human or civilized. Colonizers created their own myth of destiny, agency, and progress to obscure the knowledge that the people they oppressed were not inherently inferior. Analyzing invasion narratives such as H.G. Wells's The War of the Worlds (1898), Karel Čapek's War with the Newts (1936), Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy (1987-9) and Gwyneth Jones's Aleutian trilogy (1991-7), Rieder shows how, through imagining alternative invasion scenarios, sf is in dialogue with the ideological fictions and fantasies that supposedly justify such invasions. Sf's fantastic nature does not distance it from historical colonial projects, but gives a closer insight into the strategies used to create the ideological fantasy of colonialism.

Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr goes further, arguing that sf is itself a fantasy of empire, emerging in industrialized, imperial nations, such as America, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union, as a mediator between national cultural traditions and the rise of global capitalism. Implicated in the project of a global, technoscientific empire, sf takes place in a shared cosmos which is “governed by the laws and right of technoscience” (Csicsery-Ronay 2003: 238). Regardless of whether or not individual texts are supportive or critical of this technoscientific worldview, sf cannot escape it. Csicsery-Ronay's interpretation of technoscientific empire raises the question of whether it is possible, or desirable, to have an overarching theory of sf and empire given the growing diversity of sf produced outside the former imperial nations.

Rereading canonical sf texts

Postcolonialism often involves reexamining naturalized representations of power and dominance. Said (1978) highlights the extent to which Western colonizing powers constructed knowledge of the Orient through a discourse that encoded the otherness and inferiority of the Oriental subject. This influential analysis of a systematic, dominating discourse prompted a number of reading strategies with which critics showed how deeply these forms of knowledge are ingrained in canonical English literature. Sf critics are increasingly revisiting genre texts in this manner.

Matthew Candelaria draws parallels between the alien Overlords in Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End (1953) and the British colonial administration in India, whose record was being questioned following independence in 1947. Similar to the British colonial administration, the Overlords keep familiar structures of government, and rule indirectly through them; decide upon an administrative language (English) and impose it globally; and adopt a paternalistic attitude to humans. Candelaria argues that this novel is “deftly engineered to make the reader identify with the colonial administrators, the Overlords, and their self-sacrificing mission to better humanity” (Candelaria 2002: 38-9), hence it implicitly defends Britain's colonial record in India as one of forbearance and progress.

Peter Fitting examines the influence of Wells's The War of the Worlds on subsequent depictions of the alien as monstrous Other, and the xenophobic attitudes connected to this estranged appearance. While Wells's Martians offer a means of questioning the rationale for British imperialism (a famous passage compares the Martians invading Earth to European settlers' genocide of the Tasmanians), Fitting notes the contrasting justifications for each invasion. European colonialism claimed to be a civilizing mission, bringing religion and culture to “savages,” but the Martian invasion makes no such pretense. The Martian invasion is an act of survival by a supposedly superior race, which empties out the civilizing mission. The Martians' claims to superiority are undermined by their defeat by terrestrial bacteria, thus laying bare the “guilty conscience of imperialism” (Fitting 2000: 140).

Such reexaminations show that many sf texts do not straightforwardly advocate colonial expansion, but take a more complex and ambiguous approach to the dominant values of the time in which they were written. They also draw attention to the value-judgments and assumptions that have led to certain sf texts and authors being canonized.

Adapting postcolonial critical tools to analyze sf texts

Postcolonial reading strategies can build a better understanding of the complex relationships between power, culture, body, and identity in sf. Helen Addison-Smith uses Homi Bhabha's concept of “hybridity” to analyze the consequences of space colonization as expressed in mid-century American sf, such as James Blish's The Seedling Stars (1957), Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Colors of Space (1963), and Harry Harrison's Planet of the Damned (1962). To live on planets incapable of sustaining human life, humans cannot simply impose their unchanged, “pure” identities onto the new environment but must make radical adaptations to themselves. Bhabha's concept of hybridity focuses mainly on cultural cross-fertilization, but Addison-Smith extends this to encompass the radical biological adaptations made by the settlers in space. Their physical and cultural hybrid identities should challenge racial and biological essentialism. However, in the texts Addison-Smith analyzes, the impact of these changes is mitigated by claims that there are essential human values (individualism, adventurousness, scientific curiosity) - dominant US attitudes of the time championed as universal truths (Addison-Smith 2006: 29).

Cassie Carter uses the concepts of Orientalism and mimicry to show how Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle (1962) turns the colonial process back on America. In Dick's alternate history, in which the Axis powers won the Second World War, America is “colonized by colonized people, where the Japanese colonizers are mirror images of Western ideals and values instilled by colonialism” (Carter 1995: 333). The Japanese colonists are products of Western Orientalism, and demonstrate this by craving American consumer goods and romanticized historical artifacts from the frontier past. However, this replication of American mythology by the colonial authorities means that America is “occupied and 'oppressed' by a simulation of itself” (Carter 1995: 333). Carter extends Bhabha's interpretation of “mimicry” to analyze how mimics can themselves become colonizers, bringing with them the simulacra of the culture they imitated. Mimicry describes the means by which colonial subjects assimilate and mirror back to the colonizers their values and practices, both as imitation and mockery. The colonized mimic confronts the colonial authorities with an image which is unsettling because it is both the same and different; not quite right or quite “white” enough (Bhabha 1994: 89). Dick's alternate history doubles-up the mimicking process: American subjects imitate the culture of the Japanese authorities, itself a replication of American frontier mythology.

Addison-Smith and Carter demonstrate that postcolonial tools have to be adapted to fit the extended reach and estranging perspectives of future and alternate colonial power relations. In sf, postcolonial cultural concepts are often made literal and applied to the physical form of the alien Other. For example, cyborgs and clones can be interpreted as a combined technological and biological manifestation of the processes of hybridity and mimicry on the human body. Nisi Shawl's “Deep End” (2004) takes place on a prison ship going to colonize an alien world. The black prisoners have their minds downloaded into the cloned bodies of the rich white authorities against whom they rebelled. Instead of being not quite “white” enough, the prisoners are exact copies of their rulers. Their minds, however, are their own. Consequently, they have to negotiate racial heritage and new physical appearance into an uneasy hybrid existence, which questions where racial identity is located.

Identifying sf from outside the US and UK

Postcolonial perspectives are useful in identifying strands of political and cultural resistance in sf traditions from countries marginal to the mainstream of American and British sf, and in forming a foundation for a shared identity not simply based on the country of origin. Ralph Pordzik argues that exhausted European utopian writing has been reinvigorated by a growing range of African, Australian, Canadian, Indian, and New Zealand utopias which display similar aesthetic characteristics in order to create inclusive and flexible visions of society; heterogeneous and open-ended, they resist single definitions and subvert realist modes (Pordzik 2001: 28). Many of these utopias, such as Peter Carey's The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith (1994), are also satirical, parodying utopian societies as a sign of the inflexibility of essentialist Western values while simultaneously celebrating utopian thought's potential for social transformation (Pordzik 2001: 171). However, Pordzik uses “postcolonial” to signify overarching aesthetic techniques similar to those of “postmodernism,” thus tending to elide the specific political and national contexts of these complex utopias

Amy J. Ransom, drawing on Vijay Mishra and Bob Hodge's “oppositional post-colonialism,” emphasizes how Quebec has been shaped by the struggle for identity as a marginalized community within a settler colony (Ransom 2006: 293-4). Oppositional postcolonialism is identified by active opposition to the colonial authorities and is characterized by three key concerns (racism, a second language, political struggle) which Ransom argues are very evident in SFQ (Science Fiction Québécoise), in both parables of colonial conflicts and specific extrapolations of Canada's future. Aware of the dangers of judging the “postcoloniality” of texts by the identity of their producing nations or author, Ransom shows how SFQ's future scenarios and other worlds display similar political concerns to texts more commonly identified as “postcolonial.”

Uppinder Mehan considers the ways in which the Indian sf stories collected in It Happened Tomorrow (1993) reflect Indian concerns about technological growth, arguing that they “wrestle with the need for technological development, but are wary of one which might come at the cost of a neo-colonial relationship with the Developed Countries” (Mehan 1998: 64). Consequently, the stories “domesticate” technology by putting it to the service of traditional Indian cultural and religious beliefs. For example, in Naranjan Sinha's “The Elevation,” a robot cannot obtain full rights just by being considered human because this will not enable it to escape caste distinctions (Mehan 1998: 59), while in Shubhada Gogate's “Birthright,” the Indian government promotes the development of advanced ultrasound technology but it is then used to identify and destroy female fetuses (Mehan 1998: 62-4). The “Indianness” of such sf does not just depend on its geographical origin, but on the way in which it engages with the cultural and political struggle over the power relationships formed by technological development. These relationships are shaped by an Orientalist hierarchy which contrasts the rational, scientific West with the mystical, fantastic East (Mehan 1998: 54).

M. Elizabeth Ginway (2005) argues that, rather than domesticating technology, Brazilian sf views it with suspicion as something developed at the expense of Brazilian identity. Her proposed model for analyzing sf from a developing nation compares the forces of modernization symbolized in sf iconography with the cultural myths of that nation. She notes that Brazilian sf from the 1960s tends to be backwards-looking, with Guido Wilmar Sassi's “Mission T-935” (1963) and Levy Menezes's “Ukk” (1965) showing sensual, peace-loving Brazilians to be more powerful than technological knowledge. More recent Brazilian sf critically considers the country's marginalized position in an increasingly globalized world. Braulio Tavares's “The Ishtarians Are Among Us” (1989) and Henrique Flory's “Invaders?” (1989) use alien invasions to parallel Brazil's struggle against the stronger economies and expansive culture of developed nations like the US.

Ginway's work is complemented and contextualized by Cosmos Latinos (2003), which collects sf from Latin America and Spain. Editors Andrea L. Bell and Yolanda Molina-Gavilán chart a similar development of sf in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Cuba, with “stories from all over Latin America target[ing] big business (licit or illicit) and consumer culture as truly malignant forces, the heartless imperialist appetites that are responsible for much human suffering” (Bell and Molina-Gavilán 2003: 15). For example, Pepe Rojo's “Gray Noise” (1996) criticizes the way in which individuals become tools of sensationalist media, feeding the desire for views of violence and squalor in an urban center that may, or may not, be Mexico City.

Postcolonial parables in sf

Postcolonialism and sf also come together in a number of writing strategies. As Nancy Batty and Robert Markley state, sf provides “striking parables of European and American imperialism” (Batty and Markley 2002: 6). Sf is a means of playing out the consequences and alternative scenarios of imperialism, while drawing parallels with our own world and time. For example, Brian Attebery notes how some Australian writers produce sf stories in which a primitive alien species is eradicated, conquered, or found to be an ancient holdover from a dying race. Texts like J.M. Walsh's Vandals of the Void (1931) crudely distance the guilt and longing associated with the destruction of Aboriginal society and culture by projecting it into space. Consequently, “The indigenous Other becomes part of the textual unconscious - always present but silenced and often transmuted into symbolic form” (Attebery 2005: 387).

Some sf parables view the colonial relationship from the perspective of the marginalized or estranged. In James Tiptree Jr's “And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill's Side” (1971), humans find themselves helplessly sexually obsessed with a society of superior aliens and beholden to “some cargo-cult of the soul” (Tiptree 1975: 18). Comparing this human-alien relationship to that of the Polynesians and Europeans, Tiptree places the humans (and the reader) in the position of the colonized. David Galef (2001), Adam Roberts (2003), and Wendy Pearson (2006) all debate whether this is a fable of imperial or sexual domination, demonstrating the complex interweaving of sexuality and gender with colonial mechanisms of power. Indeed, Pearson explains the story's powerful effect in this way: “[H]umanity as a whole becomes the alien dark, a position previously occupied only by those who were subaltern, or abjected, within the human race: women, homosexuals, the colonized” (Pearson 2006: 182).

By displacing conflicts between social groups onto a parable of humans and aliens, anxieties and fantasies can be examined in unique ways. For example, Blade Runner (Scott 1982), RoboCop (Verhoeven 1987), and A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (Spielberg 2001) offer a “safe space in which to explore the controversial issues surrounding multiracial identity” (Nishime 2005: 36). The desire of many artificial lifeforms to “become human” parallels the “passing” of mixed-race people as white so as to avoid stigmatization (Nishime 2005: 40). Nishime notes that this conformist wish to internalize human values and identities contrasts with cyborgs, like RoboCop, who eventually embrace their hybridity, and thus represent the challenge that racial mixing poses to fixed identity categories. However, Sherryl Vint warns against the loss of specificity in parables of racial and colonial conflict. More often than not “in SF texts race is ignored or subsumed under the figure of the alien” (Vint 2004: 121). A human-alien dichotomy enables easy resolutions to political questions by encouraging humans to unite against a common external enemy or under a superior benevolent power. Using species differences as a parable for racial differences encodes race as a biologically essential category.

Sf as a means of imagining postcolonial science

Language and writing are often seen as the main tools of colonial control (see Ashcroft et al. 1989), but sf enables writers to explore other mechanisms of imperial authority, such as the ways in which scientific discourse and practice construct ideas of truth. Amitav Ghosh's The Calcutta Chromosome (1995) uses an alternate history to question the boundaries erected to separate notions of scientific “truth” and fiction. Subverting the Western history of science, it posits that Ronald Ross did not discover how malaria was transmitted but that Indian local knowledge and expertise played a far greater role in this medical breakthrough. It emphasizes that ideas of science, technology, and medicine were not unidirectional, but developed in cross-cultural changes and mutations. Claire Chambers analyzes how in Ghosh's narrative mainstream science shades into a deviant or spiritual science, which contravenes ideas of rational observation and mortality, emerges in the gaps and silences of the narrative, and seems to be “unknowable” (Chambers 2003: 64). Consequently, it could be interpreted as a “subaltern” science.

Gayatri Spivak inquires whether a member of the female Indian underclass, or subaltern, can speak for herself, or whether she must always be known, represented, and spoken for by others in authority. She argues that it is not that the subaltern cannot speak, but that we must not assume we can recover a unified and original subaltern consciousness: “Between patriarchy and imperialism, subject-constitution and object-formation, the figure of the woman disappears, not into a pristine nothingness, but into a violent shuttling which is the displaced figuration of the 'third-world woman' caught between tradition and modernization” (Spivak 1994: 102). Similarly, the new form of knowledge created by Ghosh's Indian lab workers shuttles between spirituality and science, and cannot be fully understood.

Elizabeth Leane claims that sf has the potential to imagine what postcolonial science might be like. Science, like colonialism, operates through a process of “othering” in which “the physical world is posited as object, as 'other' to the observer” (Leane 2002: 85). Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy (1992-6) imagines development away from this form of science, the progression from Red to Green to Blue Mars symbolizing not only the gradual colonization and terraforming of the planet but also a movement toward a utopian science open to the “other.” Leane argues that Robinson is unable to describe this successor science in detail, hence he has to use color symbolism to represent the movement toward this new science which is open to the otherness of all objects, alive or dead.

Vandana Singh's “Delhi” as postcolonial sf

What might a hybrid form of postcolonial sf be like?

This question was considered by Nalo Hopkinson and Uppinder Mehan's So Long Been Dreaming: postcolonial science fiction and fantasy (2004). The anthology's subtitle provided a unifying idea for the anthology, but also gave authors freedom to explore what it might mean. The stories range from Eden Robinson's “Terminal Avenue,” depicting a near-future Canada in which First Nations are both segregated and exploited, to Tobias S. Buckell's far-future “Necahual,” in which a Galactic Empire's rescue mission finds native and alien resistance to be more complex than they had envisaged. A question many of these stories ask is who are the supposed heirs of technological progress and of the future? As Mehan and Hopkinson both note, sf is usually narrated by the inheritors of advancement, often assumed to be white, Western, and on an adventure (Hopkinson and Mehan 2004: 7, 270), but many postcolonial science fictions shift the perspectives to societies that challenge the right of technological power or have migrated away from reductive visions of the future.

Vandana Singh's “Delhi” uses representations of time and technology to question power relationships in India. As he wanders around Delhi, Aseem sees overlapping visions of both the past and the future of the city: these visions are apparently caused by the city itself. Consequently, Aseem comes to think of Delhi as a complex being with “alien, unfathomable” need: “It is an entity in its own right, expanding every day . . . Now it is burrowing into the earth, and even later it will reach long fingers towards the stars” (Singh 2004: 94).

Aseem's glimpses of the future reveal a science-fictional city, with “tall, gem-studded minars that reach the sky, and the perfect gardens. And the ships, the silver udan-khatolas, that fly across worlds” (Singh 2004: 89). The Urdu words describing the flying machines imply this future is Indian rather than imposed by a globalized power. However, Aseem realizes that this future Delhi is built on a poor underclass, confined to the old subway system (just as present-day beggars are moved off the streets when dignitaries visit), in a subaltern city known as “Neechi Dilli.”

Aseem also sees Delhi's prosperous past before British colonization, which “brought one of the richest and oldest civilizations on earth to abject poverty in only two hundred years. They built these great edifices, gracious buildings, and fountains, but even they had to leave it all behind. Kings came and went, the goras came and went, but the city lives on” (Singh 2004: 81). This overlapping of time periods combines features from magic realist writing (colonial past haunts, and breaks into, the postcolonial present) with sf extrapolation (present-day power imbalances are the foundation of future dystopias). However, “Delhi” offers a much wider and more complex conception of time than either magic realism or sf: the city can transcend both historical and future narratives because it is a hybrid space combining influences throughout time, of which the colonial period was one moment.

Aseem seeks answers to his visions from a mysterious figure called Pandit Vidyanath, whose office contains only a computer next to a beehive. Aseem thinks this is a strange juxtaposition, until he is told, “A computer is like a beehive. Many bits and parts, none is by itself intelligent. Combine together, and you have something that can think” (Singh 2004: 86). The computer has been domesticated - produced by, and integrated into, Indian society to serve Indian culture. Aseem begins to suspect that the mysterious Vidyanath plays a pivotal role in the hidden hierarchies of organic and mechanical control that spread outwards from the computer and beehive throughout Delhi. Vidyanath “speaks only through the computer” and, it is implied, might be an Artificial Intelligence who “works for the city” (Singh 2004: 90-1). Does this mean that he is allied to the municipal authorities whose solution to poverty is merely to clear beggars off the main streets? Or does this mean he works for the living city of Delhi that resists and persists?

The potential of Delhi's future remains uncertain; the reasons for Aseem's visions are unexplained; the questions about Vidyanath's identity and his connection to the city are left unanswered. Instead of providing a solution to social problems, technology obscures the mechanisms of power in Delhi, just as the flying “udan-khatolas” and bright towers obscure the underclass who have no access to advanced technology. While Aseem realizes that he has to do what he can to prevent the undercity of Neechi Dilli being created, the palimpsest of time-streams and the obfuscating divination of Vidyanath's computer complicate the supposedly direct link between technological advancement and social prosperity in India.

Mehan argues that “If we do not imagine our futures, postcolonial peoples risk being condemned to be spoken about and for again” (Mehan 2004: 270). Sf offers tools with which to do so, but they bear the legacy of the imperialist and colonialist projects which shaped them. Postcolonial sf must reshape them, even as it uses them, to imagine alternative visions of the future.",,2137948771,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Reid, Michelle"," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

"3. Fiction, 1895-1926 (Part I: History)","The years 1895 and 1926 mark monumental events in the history of sf: the publication of The Time Machine, H.G. Wells's first important work of fiction, and the inauguration of Amazing Stories (1926-2005), edited by Hugo Gernsback, the first magazine devoted exclusively and explicitly to publishing sf (or “scientifiction,” as Gernsback then called it). But there is no more than a loose connection between the two events, and certainly no developmental or progressive history that leads us from Wells's artistic achievement to Gernsback's entrepreneurship. In fact, Gernsback's pulp milieu bears only a slight resemblance to the publishing context in which Wells worked, and Gernsback's one novel-length piece of fiction, Ralph 124C 41 +: a romance of the year 2660 (1911-12), entirely lacks the craft and thoughtfulness that make The Time Machine important. The history of sf in this period is diffuse, even if one simplifies the task by concentrating on English-language fiction, as I will do here. Writing that history involves the retrospective gathering together of scattered materials that find a clearly delineated focus and identity as early sf largely because of Gernsback's commercial project.

Nonetheless, Wells's importance is quite independent of Gernsback's. We would still be reading The Time Machine and assigning it some kind of special place in the history of generic innovation even if Gernsback's reprintings of Wells - and publication of Wells's many imitators - had not so thoroughly woven him into the fabric of pulp sf. The year 1895 marks a watershed in the history of sf not just because of The Time Machine itself, but because it inaugurates the most important phase of Wells's career. The major works that followed, including The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), “The Star” (1897), The War of the Worlds (1898), When the Sleeper Wakes (1899), The First Men in the Moon (1901), “The Land Ironclads” (1903), and “The Country of the Blind” (1904), comprise arguably the most important and influential body of fiction any writer has contributed to the genre. It is so impressive an achievement that it has sometimes inspired the exaggerated claim that Wells invented sf itself. In fact, he took up a range of devices and themes that were already being widely used, including time travel, future-war stories, contact with lost races, extraterrestrial journeys, scientific experiments gone awry, utopian speculation, and quasi-apocalyptic natural disaster. One of the distinctions of the fiction of Wells's great decade is that, more than any other writer, he gathered together in one place almost all of the disparate threads of what we now identify as early sf.

Even more compelling than the breadth of Wells's subject matter, however, is the depth of his exploration and transformation of it. In The Time Machine, for example, Wells seized upon and made his own a plot device that had enjoyed a great deal of popularity in the preceding decade. One of the most widely read and hotly discussed books of the period, Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (1888), narrates a contemporary New Englander's visit to the future where he observes a vastly more efficient and equitable society. Its famous and influential polemical counterpart, William Morris's News from Nowhere (1890), also uses time travel to promote a different vision of social improvement. Mark Twain's anti-clerical satire, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889), sends its time-traveler in the opposite direction, pitting a contemporary engineer's rationality and know-how against the brutality and superstition that rule Twain's imaginary sixth-century Arthurian England. It is sometimes said that Wells's key innovation upon the time-travel plot is his invention of the time machine itself, allowing him to replace the accidental time-travelers and Rip-Van-Winkle-like trances of these earlier stories with the deliberate exploratory journey of his scientist protagonist. Instead of the guided tours by which Bellamy's and Morris's visitors learn about the future, then, Wells's Time Traveler encounters the world of AD 802701 as a riddle that only gradually unfolds its secrets. The drama of interpretation, as the Time Traveler works through a series of hypotheses about the relationship between the surface-dwelling Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks who inhabit this far-future Thames Valley, makes for a fluent synthesis of the utopian and satirical material typical of earlier time-travel stories. And just as this plot's dynamism sets it apart from those of Bellamy and Morris, the clarity of Wells's exposition distinguishes his novel from the earlier, comparable, but somewhat opaque attempt at depicting a posthuman future in William Henry Hudson's A Crystal Age (1887).

Yet Wells's marvelous machine and streamlined plot development would be worth little more than a footnote in the history of sf were it not for the visionary power of the futures his Time Traveler visits. Sf, like the historical novel, is intimately bound up with ideas about historical change, especially the linked notions of progress, evolution, and modernity. For example, Grant Allen's time-travel novel, The British Barbarians (1895), exploits the widely shared assumption, which informed an entire generation of anthropologists, that contemporary Europe represented the fully developed phase of a history of civilization whose past developing phases were visible in non-European, savage societies. Allen (who, like Wells, was an advocate and popularizer of Darwinism) simply reverses the perspective of the ideology of progress by having an anthropologist from the future visit present-day England to study its savage rituals and superstitious beliefs. The Time Machine also reverses contemporary assumptions about progress, but, unlike Allen, Wells does not leave the ethnocentric framework of the ideology of progress intact. While Allen's future is simply and unquestionably superior to the present, Wells depicts a future in which humanity has degenerated into the subhuman Eloi and Morlocks, and then gives this degeneration a cosmic scale in the protagonist's brief, bleak glimpse of the entropic heat-death of life itself. Wells also attacks the identification of progress with industrialized Europe, by making the speciation of the Eloi and the Morlocks the ironic outcome of the triumph of technological rationality over scarcity. Furthermore, the future's technological triumph is undone in this manner not because its inhabitants lapse into the habits of “savage” societies, but because it perpetuates a form of savagery peculiar to contemporary “advanced” societies, the class division between capitalists and laborers. In the long run, the upper class's exploitation of the workers turns into dependence upon, and finally utter subjection to, them as the Eloi end up not only being tended to by the Morlocks but also becoming a staple item of their diet. Finally, this dialectical reversal of the capitalist masters into the slaves, or more precisely the cattle, of their machinetending former servants obliterates the opposition between nature and culture itself, turning the man-made arrangement of class duties and responsibilities into a grotesque natural symbiosis. Thus Wells's tale challenges the entire framework of assumptions that bolster chauvinistic belief in the superior rationality of European industrial civilization. And Wells does so with a seamless weaving together of extravagant conjecture and realistic detail - as one of the Time Traveler's listeners comments, “the story was so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober” (Wells 1987: 89) - that would remain one of the benchmarks of stylistic achievement in the genre.

The Time Machine set a high standard that much of Wells's fiction lived up to in the years that followed. The depth and clarity he brought to the time-travel plot is typical of his handling of other popular types: invasion and the near-future war in The War of the Worlds and “The Land Ironclads”; the mad scientist whose experiments go disastrously wrong in The Island of Doctor Moreau and The Invisible Man; the extraterrestrial journey in The First Men in the Moon; the explorer's encounter with a lost race in “The Country of the Blind”; and apocalyptic natural disaster in “The Star.” He made some remarkable innovations in these stories. For example, the Martians of The War of the Worlds are the prototype of all the cyborgs and the hyper-encephalic future humans and extraterrestrials of later sf, and in the Selenites of First Men in the Moon Wells pioneered the strategy of modeling alien anatomy and social organization on insects. But what characterizes Wells's great decade on the whole is not the novelty of his invention, but rather the way he breathes vitality into the commonplace plots and devices of an already thriving early sf.

What we now call early sf was perhaps nothing more than the loose aggregation of such commonplace devices. No one was consciously writing, publishing, or reading “sf” around 1900. Even the association of Wells's fiction with that of contemporaries like M.P. Shiel, George Griffith, and J.W. Beresford under the rubric of “scientific romance” (Stableford 1985) is more a way of identifying these writers' common tendencies and shared milieu than it is the delineation of an explicit, self-consciously employed generic category. Nonetheless, Gernsback and the American magazine writers did not invent sf out of nothing, and Gernsback himself was quite eager to identify a canon of earlier works that defined the sort of story his magazine was looking to publish. A generation of bibliographers has documented an almost exponential decade-by-decade proliferation, from the 1870s to the 1920s, of stories set in the future, or about marvelous inventions and heroic or mad scientists (the prototypes being Thomas Edison and Victor Frankenstein, respectively), or involving journeys into previously unexplored areas of the world (usually the poles or imaginary subterranean caverns, as the mapping of the world's inhabitable surface neared completion), or journeys into outer space, or into the past or the future, and so on. (The most comprehensive and informative of these bibliographies is Bleiler 1990; others, each of which has its strengths, include Clareson 1984, Clarke 1961, and Suvin 1983.) The ground for Wells's achievement was prepared by this steady growth, which was punctuated by more spectacular publishing phenomena such as Bellamy's utopia, or before that H. Rider Haggard's enormously successful lost-race romances (starting with King Solomon's Mines (1885) followed by She (1886) and Allan Quatermain (1887)), and the ongoing popularity of Jules Verne's voyages extraordinaires, all of which established a reading audience already attuned to a set of recognizable themes and expectations for Wells to exploit. The impact of Verne and Wells was crucial to the formation of sf, but the growing market for tales oriented toward the future, stories that extrapolated upon recent scientific and technological discoveries, and stories exploring utopian or merely exotic social formations was broader and more miscellaneous than can be accounted for by the influence of individual writers. Those increasing numbers who, during these decades, wrote and published early sf must have been responding to demands rooted in their society's collective experience of change and its collective investment in modernity.

First, these demands point toward an economic context. Surely the importance of technical innovation and scientific training to the growth and maintenance of a large-scale industrial capitalist economy has a great deal to do not only with the ongoing popularity of Verne's fiction, with its marvelous inventions and lengthy expositions of scientific fact, throughout this period, but also with the commercial success of the American dime novel's fictional adolescent hero-scientists, Frank Reade Jr (1892-8) and Tom Swift (1910-41). If Gernsback's vision of sf as an educational tool, his interest in amateur radio, and his other publishing ventures, like Modern Electrics (1908-13) and Science and Invention (1920-31), are any indication, the presence of a significant audience comprising young readers oriented toward engineering and fascinated by gadgetry was crucial to early sf.

Second, the social environment that attended the climax and crisis of imperialism nurtured the growing market for sf. The tensions of imperialist competition clearly underlie one of the most important and prolific veins of sf before the First World War, the invasion stories and forecasts of future war that Wells so decisively transformed in The War of the Worlds (on the future-war motif, see Clarke 1992). The vogue for such stories would seem not only to exploit popular identification with imperial projects and popular anxieties about becoming the victims rather than the wielders of imperial military power, but also to point once again to the economic backdrop of large-scale industrial production. The popularity of future-war stories coincides with the first great industrial arms race, from George Chesney's phenomenally successful, controversial and influential cautionary tale of a successful German invasion of England, The Battle of Dorking (1871), published in the aftermath of Germany's shockingly swift victory in the Franco-Prussian war, to the Great War itself, the horrors of which far exceeded its many fictional forecasts. The way in which Wells's Martian superweapons overwhelm earthly opponents echoes many an earlier fictional encounter involving new generations of armored ships or large artillery. Many tales of invasion and near-future war were strongly realistic, heavily concerned with extrapolating credible technological advances, as exemplified by Wells's well-wrought and critically acute “The Land Ironclads.” But the future-war plot on the whole steered steadily away from realistic prediction into ever more extravagant fantasy. Arthur Train and Robert Wood's The Man Who Rocked the Earth (1915) is typical, with its heady combination of imperialist politics, superweapons, mass destruction, and eccentric scientists - a mysterious and isolated one, who invents a flying machine and an incredibly powerful weapon with which he threatens to destroy the world unless national leaders put an end to their war; and a second, avuncular, absent-minded one, who saves the world from the first.

The general bellicosity of the milieu is impressive. British and American fantasists of war imagined their countries invading or being invaded by every possible national opponent (Germany was the most frequent choice) and many impossible ones. Xenophobia and racism were endemic. It is no coincidence that Wells's blood-drinking Martian invaders appeared in Pearson's Magazine in the same year that Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897) gave classic form to the plot of vampiric invasion. When the fantasy of international war expanded from domestic invasion to global conflict, the sides frequently were divided along racial lines. George Griffith's The Angel of the Revolution (1893) is an early example, M.P. Shiel's The Yellow Danger (1898) among the most extravagant. Shiel's plot involves a quasi-migratory Chinese invasion of Europe by an army of 400 million who simply walk across the countryside, laying it to waste like a plague of locusts. Carefully diagramed naval battles are a standard feature Shiel's novel shares with many future-war stories; his climactic battle is remarkable because it produces 20 million Chinese casualties. Shiel follows this with the most gruesome turn of all when the English deliberately unleash a cholera epidemic upon the Chinese swarm on the continent, killing some 150 million in the process. The theme of the Yellow Peril only grew more popular after Shiel, continuing unabated right into the interwar years, especially in the USA.

To some extent the scope of the disasters imagined in these racial fantasies partakes of a more generalized apocalypticism that manifested itself in stories of cataclysmic transformation, both natural and human-made - volcanic eruptions in Allen's “The Thames Valley Catastrophe” (1897) and Shiel's The Purple Cloud (1901); astral collisions in Wells's “The Star” (1897) and Arthur Conan Doyle's “The Poison Belt” (1915); a mad scientist's experiments in Frederick Turner Jane's The Violet Flame (1899); and all-out class warfare in Jack London's The Iron Heel (1908). Such stories vary considerably in the degree to which they perform secular transformation of enduring motifs in the Christian tradition, and the persistence of mythological motifs like flooding and cyclicality invites other forms of psychological and cultural interpretation as well. After the First World War, especially in England, this apocalyptic strain frequently blended with pessimism about the future of civilization in novels like Edward Shanks's The People of the Ruins (1920) and P. Anderson Graham's The Collapse of Homo Sapiens (1923).

Throughout the nineteenth century, colonial and imperialist expansion also provided an environment in which popular audiences avidly consumed both fictional and nonfictional accounts of exploration. By the early twentieth century, while the extent of Britain's empire (and of European imperialism in general) was reaching its peak, the still unexplored areas of the globe had become few and extremely remote. Stories of exploration became correspondingly more fantastic. Extraterrestrial adventure remained a relatively minor motif during most of this period; in the late nineteenth century extraterrestrial visitors were more often associated with occult wisdom and utopian speculation than with the earthly frontier. The great majority of imaginary exploration before Edgar Rice Burroughs's Barsoom stories (beginning with “Under the Moons of Mars” (serialized 1912, as book A Princess of Mars 1917)) occurred wherever on Earth the writers could still place an isolated enclave for earthly travelers to penetrate - in the African or South American interior, at the poles or under the Earth. But writers employed these options with impressive frequency. Historians of sf have had little to say about the lost-race and lost-world stories that make up several hundred of the more than 2,500 items in Bleiler (1990), but they are important precursors to the later development of adventure-oriented sf (see Rieder 2008).

Lost-race and lost-world narratives - the paradigm for lost-race fiction is set by Haggard's novels mentioned above; some typical, readable later examples are Frank Aubrey's The Devil-Tree of El Dorado (1897) and The Queen of Atlantis (1899), and Robert Ames Bennett's Thyra: a romance of the polar pit (1901); the lost-world romance is a variation pioneered by Conan Doyle's The Lost World (1912) - are on the whole formulaic and often relatively transparent fantasies of acquisition in which a small group of white men discovers an isolated civilization where they have exciting adventures finding treasure and love. The explorers frequently become embroiled in a civil war, allying themselves with a sympathetic princess against a perverse priesthood. Entry into the lost world is an ordeal, often involving a tortuous passage through an underground tunnel or river; this entrance is typically sealed upon the explorers' exit, making their journey a private and unrepeatable one rather than the vanguard of colonial penetration. These formulaic elements combine to construct a wish-fulfilling ideological distortion that casts colonial exploration and expropriation as a return to nature, a rediscovery of lost histories and properties, and salvation for the good natives (who embrace the white men as friends or lovers) against their true enemies, the bad natives (who regard the white men as invaders and sexual rivals). Yet in the best of such narratives, like Haggard's or Conan Doyle's, such fantasies are offered up for enjoyment and simultaneously exposed to critical examination, especially by enforcing some ironic distance between the narrator and the expeditionary leader.

Even in the hands of less expert writers, lost-race and lost-world narratives offer their readers a fascinating array of ideas about social and cultural possibilities. The stories tend to take an anthropological orientation that is ingenuously revealed in the subtitle of Thomas Janvier's The Aztec Treasure House: a romance of contemporaneous antiquity (1890). They often combine the idea that non-European societies represent moments in Europe's past with utopian speculation, as various lost races practice forms of communism, polygamy, nudity, vegetarianism, and eugenic discipline. Although most lost-race civilizations are based on savage, classical, or medieval societies, some are futuristic, as in Will Harben's The Land of the Changing Sun (1894). When combined with evolutionary theory, the scientific orientation of such fiction produces another entire subgenre about the relationship of human nature to culture, the narrative of human prehistory, such as Stanley Waterloo's The Story of Ab (1897), Wells's “A Story of the Stone Age” (1897), and London's Before Adam (1907). The same anthropological perspective, combined with a kind of vertiginous oscillation between the protagonist scientist's racist contempt for a contemporary savage society and his intellectual awe before what he takes to be a long-lost artifact of a super-advanced extraterrestrial visitor, characterizes London's “The Red One” (1918), one of the best pieces of sf from this period. But no one employed lost-race and lost-world geography with greater energy or a more spectacular proliferation of anachronistic materials than Burroughs (see, for example, At the Earth's Core (1914) or The Land That Time Forgot (1918)) and his one rival in terms of commercial domination of the pre-Amazing magazines, A. Merritt (see The Moon Pool (1919)). It is to a large extent Burroughs's combination of lost-race adventure formulas with an extraterrestrial, part-savage, part-medieval, part-futuristic setting in A Princess of Mars and its sequels that set the stage for the space operas of E.E. “Doc” Smith and Edmond Hamilton in the Gernsback magazines. (Sometimes Robert William Cole's dreary The Struggle for Empire: a story of the year 2236 (1900) is cited as the first space opera, but this is no more than a piece of trivia; Burroughs and Merritt are the most significant figures.) Finally, in assessing the importance of lost-race fiction, we need to remember that its basic structure was often used as a vehicle of satire, both before Haggard's commercial breakthrough (Samuel Butler's Erewhon (1872)) and after (Wells's “The Country of the Blind”). In fact, two of the best pieces of feminist speculation in this period employ lost-race motifs: Inez Gillmore's very fine but little-known allegory Angel Island (1914), and Charlotte Perkins Gilman's deservedly famous parthenogenetic utopia Herland (1915).

Although we can plausibly identify several economic and social factors that encouraged the growing market for early sf, the coherence and the limits of the category itself remain open to debate. Perhaps the key question about this period is whether, and at what point, we can say that a new set of generic expectations had become sufficiently widespread and well enough defined to organize the production, distribution, and reception of the literature assembled in the bibliographies. Contemporaries' persistent association of Verne with Wells, to the annoyance of both, suggests the presence of some such recognition, because as individual artists they resemble one another so little that their association can only rest on some kind of generic common ground. This would imply that, decades before Amazing Stories, Verne and Wells were perceived to be staking out a new, if perhaps not very precise, position in the terrain of literary possibilities. And that terrain itself was rapidly changing. The emergent sf of 1895-1926 comes into visibility against the backdrop of the generic turmoil associated with the growth and increased diversity of reading audiences and with the marketing practices of what would soon come to be called mass culture. Sf attains the status of a recognizable genre within this mass-cultural transformation of the entire system of literary genres. In this connection, the somewhat inchoate state of early sf, compared with its relatively clearer status after the American magazines came to name and dominate the genre, makes the period all the more interesting and instructive.

One could well argue, in fact, that the loose boundaries, imprecise definition, and disparate audiences of 1895-1926 comprise a far more typical state of affairs for a literary genre than the one that has so often been the point of departure for discussions about sf, namely the highly self-conscious elaboration of the genre in the American magazines of the late 1930s through the 1950s, spearheaded by a powerful editor (John W. Campbell), featuring a highly visible group of writers strongly and sometimes exclusively associated with the genre, and attended by a self-identified, committed, and very vocal group of fans. The most serious attempt to come to terms with the differences between Wells's generic environment and that of sf's so-called “Golden Age” remains Stableford (1985), which describes a field of production strongly bifurcated along national lines, dominated by one-volume book publication in the UK, and by magazine publication, with a concomitant emphasis on the short story, in the US. The British “scientific romance,” the tradition of Wells, flourished from the late nineteenth century into the 1950s, but from the 1940s on it was increasingly overshadowed and eventually displaced by American “sf,” the tradition of Burroughs, Merritt, and Gernsback. But the opposition Stableford details could well be considered less a national than an endemic one developing between mass culture and the older literary practices that persisted alongside it, which were increasingly forced to redefine themselves in opposition to it.

Putting the divided field of early sf alongside the quasi-programmatic unities of the “Golden Age” helps remind us that sf itself is not merely a mass-market genre. Burroughs, with his tireless reiteration of a successful adventure formula, is certainly a prototypical mass-market writer, whose corpus resembles that of Zane Grey or Agatha Christie at least as closely as it does that of any other early sf writer. But Gernsback, in the first issue of Amazing Stories, would call upon Wells and Verne and Edgar Allan Poe, not Burroughs, as models; and the fact that Wells enjoyed success across a number of genres, including the realist novel, makes him anything but a special case, as witness the contributions to sf by Joseph Conrad (The Inheritors (1901)) and E.M. Forster (the important early dystopia, “The Machine Stops” (1908)). Outside of England, much of the best early sf was produced by writers with high prestige in other fields, such as the eminent French sociologist Gabriel Tarde, whose splendid satire Underground Man (1905) may have provided important inspiration for Forster's story; or John MacMillan Brown, chancellor of the University of New Zealand, whose Riallora (1897) and Limanora (1903) combine scathing satire against religious orthodoxy, racism, colonialism, and bureaucracy with one of the period's most ambitious and elaborately detailed futuristic utopias; or the great Czech writer Karel Čapek, who is most often remembered in sf history for inventing the word “robot” in RUR (Rossum's Universal Robots) (1920), but was also the most prominent writer of realist fiction in his country at the time of his death in 1938. Sometimes the affiliation of sf with older and more prestigious literary forms, such as the strong element of satire always present in the dystopia (for example, Yevgeny Zamyatin's We (written 1920, translated into English 1924)), has tended to isolate these strains of sf from the rest of the genre, but such hybrid products are arguably just as persistent and definitive a feature of the genre as the formulas of Burroughs or the marketing strategy of Gernsback.

Nonetheless, it is to the pulp magazines and their reconfiguration of fictional genres that we owe the dominant version of sf. The association between magazine publication and early sf goes back as far as the publication of Chesney's The Battle of Dorking in Blackwood's (1817-1980), or even, if one accepts Gernsback's claims, to Poe's magazine publications. But the crafting of magazines that pursued a sharply defined niche audience by publishing a very consistent genre of fiction becomes part of the history of sf when the success of Burroughs's “Under the Moons of Mars” and “Tarzan of the Apes” in All-Story (1905-20) in 1912 helped to focus and intensify the genre specialization of All-Story and its companion Argosy (1882-1978). Gernsback had already entered the publishing field in 1908 with Modern Electrics, which became Electrical Experimenter in 1913 and later Science and Invention. He began to make scientifically oriented fiction a regular part of Modern Electrics after publishing Ralph 124C 41 + there in 1911-12, and in 1923 he published a special “scientifiction” issue of Science and Invention, the year in which another important magazine, Weird Tales (1923-54), entered the field. In April 1926, when Gernsback published the first issue of Amazing Stories, Weird Tales featured on its cover a story by Robert E. Howard, the patriarch of swords and sorcery. Thus the mixture, in that first issue of Amazing, of reprinted stories by Poe, Verne, and Wells with three more recent magazine pieces (by George Allan England, Austin Hall, and G. Peyton Wertenbaker) suggestively combines an appeal to established, prestigious favorites with a selective endorsement of Gernsback's immediate milieu. Whatever we make of Gernsback's contribution to the development of modern sf, the magazines of 1912-26 offer a rich and still inadequately explored opportunity for research into its mass-cultural roots.",,2137953204,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Rieder, John"," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

30. Queer Theory (Part II: Theory),"Canadian journalist Robert Fulford recently published an attack on queer theory, which he defines as “an academic discipline that prides itself on finding gay subtexts in apparently heterosexual stories” (Fulford 2007: A22). A worse definition of queer theory would be hard to find, but Fulford's fulminations are rendered entirely, if unintentionally, humorous when he notes that his target, a postdoctoral fellow, Jes Battis, “writes about everything from hidden gay themes in TV to comedies like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.” His objections to queer Buffy studies are remarkable, however, given that the series does indeed include queer characters, making the search for subtext moot. In season four, Willow came out as a lesbian and mere months after Fulford's article the protagonist herself became involved in a same-sex affair with another female vampire slayer in issue 12 of the comic book that continues where the television show ended (Gustines 2008). This would seem to make both Buffy and Buffy pretty queer. Perhaps the only other onscreen female sf character to have excited such intense academic interest is Ripley from the Alien films (1979-97), who seems almost created to provoke queer readings that are not at all about homoerotic subtext. Indeed, queer theory's prime interest is in the workings of the normative, that is, of the ways in which discourses about what is and is not “normal” function to discipline human bodies and behaviors.

From its somewhat nebulous inception, queer theory was a powerful tool for the utopian project of rethinking the politics and history of sexuality and, extending from sexuality's centrality to the contemporary Western psyche, pretty much everything else: “an understanding of virtually any aspect of Western culture must be, not merely incomplete, but damaged in its central substance to the degree that it does not incorporate a critical analysis of modern homo/heterosexual definition” (Sedgwick 1990: 1). According to Foucault (1980), the modern world has so overvalued sexuality that it has come to seem central to everything that humans are and do, and has become subject to - perhaps even the central subject of - a new discipline of “normalcy.” Where earlier regimes had depended on established authorities, notably religion, to determine proper from improper, saint from sinner, by the late nineteenth century an entire disciplinary regime of “biopower,” bolstered by the new authorities of science, medicine, psychiatry, criminology, and statistics, was in place, defining the good as what is most common (hence Derek Jarman's quip that “Heterosexuality isn't normal, it's just common” (Jarman 1992: 19)).

Ros Jennings (1995) points to a number of moments in the Alien films in which issues of gender and sexuality are rendered in ways that either reinforce or subvert normative expectations. For most of its duration, Alien (Scott 1979) appears to subvert gender conventions and also, perhaps, simplistic expectations that the Hollywood protagonist must be heterosexual by allowing Ripley a “male” narrative role and by failing to code her as heterosexual. However, the conclusion reinscribes normative discourses of gender and sexuality, when Ripley, dressed in a vest and skimpy underwear, is exposed to the viewer's gaze. This gaze is presumptively male, the camera framing women's bodies from a masculine perspective that receives erotic pleasure from the act of looking (Mulvey 1975). Jennings argues that:

The interest of this scene . . . is in how it is constructed for maximum voyeuristic effect. For a few brief minutes it sexualizes Ripley in a way that is not even hinted at in the rest of the film . . . By rendering her available to male voyeurism, Scott's control of filming in the final scene ensures that in addition to the “so-called masculine” traits of bravery, technical ability, and so on . . . she now signifies a wholly intelligible form of femininity.
(Jennings 1995: 196, 197)
Restoring Ripley to this form also involves recuperating her for heterosexuality by making her available to the voyeuristic male gaze. Gender, in this sense, is always already a function of sexuality, since women become women in the process of becoming the objects of men's desire. In other words, sexual difference is not merely the necessary ground for heterosexuality, but also the product of it. Drawing on the work of Luce Irigaray, Judith Butler argues that sexual difference is not a fact but a question, “the question for our times,” and that the problem is “how to cross this otherness? How to cross it without crossing it, without domesticating its terms? How to remain attuned to what remains permanently unsettled about the question?” (Butler 2004: 177). In thinking about Butler's consideration of the endurance of sexual difference, the difficulties of crossing it, and the extent to which, for many people, any movement beyond or outside of it is quite literally unthinkable, we need to ask about the relationship between sexual difference and gender. The distinctions that people draw between these terms - some argue that gender is feminism's object of study, while sex and sexuality belong to lesbian and gay studies; the Vatican insists that gender in human rights language is “nothing other than a code for homosexuality”; some feminists claim that “sexual difference is the preferred term to gender, that 'sexual difference' indicates a fundamental difference, and that gender indicates a merely constructed and variable effect” (Butler 2004: 181) - suggests a petrification of meaning at the level of the body: gender may be what the body does, but sexual difference is what it is. Butler notes, however, that “the body gives rise to language, and that language carries bodily aims, and performs bodily deeds that are not always understood by those who use language to accomplish certain conscious aims” (Butler 2004: 199).

In Ursula K. Le Guin's experiment with gender, The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), her use of male pronouns for the hermaphroditic Gethenians produces particular, albeit variable, imaginative relationships between the reader's own embodiment and the bodies of her aliens, who have neither permanent genders nor sexual differences, but who, as a result, tell us something about whether gender and sexual difference can be thought of as distinct ontological categories, that is, specific types of being-in-the-world. The relationship between gender and sexual difference is thus much more problematic than a simple dichotomy between being and doing. Where Le Guin simply removes the framework for sexual difference, Butler asks why it cannot “itself move beyond binarity into multiplicity?” (Butler 2004: 197):

If the new gender politics argues against the idealization of dimorphism, then does it argue against the primacy of sexual difference itself? And if technologies of the body (surgical, hormonal, athletic) generate new forms of gender, is this precisely in the service of inhabiting a body more fully or does it constitute a perilous effacement? It seems crucial to keep these questions open so that we might work theoretically and politically in broad coalitions. The lines we draw are invitations to cross over and that crossing over, as any nomadic subject knows, constitutes who we are.
(Butler 2004: 203)
If sexual difference is the question for our times, it is therefore a question for sf, but one might also ask whether it is a question of sf. Is the meaning and “identity” of sf constituted by its various crossings over this particular question? Can we even begin to think about an sf that is not defined in advance by its relationship to sex or gender or sexual difference and to sexuality? Can we begin to articulate where in sf we might find works that are consciously crossing over the lines drawn around and between gender/s? I thus take the idea of “undoing gender” to stand in for a long series of questions that begin with the “fundamental nature” of sexual difference, the supposedly implacable necessity of sexual dimorphism and its relationship both to the bodies and to the ways of living in the world which it defines, and to the political and practical implications of feminist, queer, and postmodern projects which have often been taken as impractically and apolitically utopian - pie-in-the-sky theorizing which lacks material consequences. But the construction of sexual and gender binaries invariably has material effects, some of them extreme, even lethal (as I write this, a 19-year-old student in Britain waits for the results of his appeal against a deportation order that would return him to Iran, where his lover has already been arrested, tortured, and executed for the “crime” of homosexuality).

In Candas Jane Dorsey's A Paradigm of Earth (2001), the “queer” protagonist, Morgan, lives in a near-future Canada in which human rights are being chipped away, and in which being queer - that is, outside patriarchal heterosexual norms - is coming to have ever more drastic material consequences. Encountering an apparently closeted minor bureaucrat, Morgan thus asks the old, coded question “Are you a friend of Dorothy's?”

Chelsea blushed . . . “My mom used to say that. Yeah, I used to be, but I sold Dorothy down the river about three years ago. I can't afford to take tea with Dorothy any more, the way things are.”
(Dorsey 2001: 18)
Into this context of repression and hostility, Dorsey introduces an alien species, a small number of whom arrive in government buildings around the world. Before they are “erased” and left a blank slate for humans to teach as they will, one of them says, “Earth is needed to know.” The Canadian government hires Morgan to raise “its” alien, Blue, because she is the first childcare worker to whom it responds, and because the secret-service official in charge of the alien, Mr Grey, is an “old-fashioned” cop who is not prejudiced against Morgan for her sexuality nor for the cooperative household she has established in a rundown mansion. Dorsey thus sets two visions of how the world might be against each other: a racially multicultural but otherwise not at all diverse near-future dystopia in which the haves have won the war against the have-nots and the world is being run by “the new breed of fin-de-siècle specialist, who had grown up language-challenged and idea-poor, believing the political cant of selfishness” (Dorsey 2001: 62); and a queer, communitarian, basically socialist approach, whose adherents believe in equality and participatory democracy. Unsurprisingly, most of Mr Grey's colleagues are suspicious and fearful of the visibly different alien, who has blue skin and no biological sex. Only Morgan and Mr Grey resist the temptation to assign the alien a gender. Through their concern for Blue and their mutual distaste for the social Darwinist “dictatorship of meanness” (Dorsey 2001: 62), Morgan and Mr Grey become unlikely allies.

A Paradigm of Earth rings the changes on the themes and situation of The Left Hand of Darkness. While Le Guin has a single human, Genly Ai, arrive on Gethen, where everyone is hermaphroditic and where “gender” as he understands it makes no sense at all, Dorsey places a single hermaphroditic alien in a future not dissimilar to the reader's present. Like The Left Hand of Darkness, Dorsey's novel is informed by the sex/ gender politics of its time, notably the swing - variable but apparent throughout the Western world - to the political right, to more conservative, more patriarchal assumptions about what is normal, and to a more oppressive response to the problems posed by the diversity of human sexuality. The encounter with an alien or aliens for whom sex and gender work quite differently exposes both how constructed and thoroughly naturalized ideas about sex, gender, and sexuality are in any given time and place. Both novels also reveal, not always deliberately, the homogenizing power of “normal” and the extent to which discourses of normalcy discipline human populations to remain within a narrow range of authorized and approved behaviors.

William B. Turner writes that “Queer theory results from a particular conceptual break that has occurred unevenly in western Europe and the United States [and Canada, Australia and New Zealand] since World War II” and which may, in part, have resulted from recognizing “the moral and political bankruptcy of Nazism” (Turner 2000: 3). The fascists' program of racial perfection derived from many of the important and ascendant discourses of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including assumptions about the role and purpose of sex (indeed, homophobia and patriarchal heterosexuality were central to Nazism: to ensure the triumph of the race, men had to be convinced that their function was to impregnate women and women that their role was to bear Aryan babies). Whatever its causes, the post-Second World War period in the West was increasingly one of dissatisfaction with the oppressive regime of sexual norms and of a growing desire to understand how normative ideologies had come to assume such an apparently naturalized force within human society. The results were manifold: the Civil Rights movement, second-wave feminism, and a burgeoning lesbian and gay activist movement that was not, initially, reducible to “gay rights,” but that saw gay liberation as presaging a more broadly based movement toward sexual liberation for all humanity and a new search for what Michel Foucault called “as yet unforeseen kinds of relationships” (Foucault 1997: 229).

One of the ways in which A Paradigm of Earth reveals the triumph of a neoconservative ideology is through characters who assert that queerness is “unnatural”: for example, a letter to the editor supporting a new law changing the age of consent for same-sex sexual activity to 25 maintains that, “If impressionable young men and women are exposed to these unnatural pleasures before they have had the opportunity to make a commitment to spouse and family, society risks losing any chance to reproduce itself” (Dorsey 2001: 16). With a population of more than six billion, logic would suggest that encouraging reproduction is tolerably absurd - but there are always more underlying discourses than simple homophobia. In the West, at least, concerns over falling birth rates are also about maintaining an economic system dependent on perpetual growth and about the white population of European-settled countries losing ground to more recent immigrants. By linking neoconservatism and neoliberalism with repressive sexual ideologies, social Darwinist approaches to the welfare of citizens, and an increasingly patriarchal and authoritarian state, Dorsey echoes Foucault's contention that contemporary disciplinary regimes are founded on a “biopower” that emerged in the mid-nineteenth century and took sex as its primary object: “Sex was a means of access both to the life of the body and the life of the species. It was employed as a standard for the disciplines and as a basis for regulation . . . Broadly speaking, at the juncture of the 'body' and the 'population,' sex became a crucial target of a power organized around the management of life rather than the menace of death” (Foucault 1980: 146, 147). Foucault notes that this transformation from using the threat of death to using disciplines and discourses of bodily health, propriety, and normality to regulate behavior, emerged at the same time as and worked in concert with the emergence of “racism in its modern, 'biologizing' statist form” (Foucault 1980: 149). The result was “a long series of permanent interventions at the level of the body, conduct, health, and everyday life, [which] received their color and their justification from the mythical concern with protecting the purity of the blood and ensuring the triumph of the race” (Foucault 1980: 149).

The shift in Dorsey's futuristic multicultural Canada is from “race” in its “biologizing” sense to species, and to the fear that the aliens' arrival creates. If “we” are not alone, then who are these others? And once their emissaries have learnt from us, what will the aliens, with their presumably superior technology, do with this knowledge? Is Blue simply on Earth to learn what it means to be human or is there a more sinister purpose behind its education? However, as Mr Grey says, when Blue is eventually taken back by whomever sent it, “Earth has sent an emissary after all” (Dorsey 2001: 341). His daughter objects that the alien cannot be “an emissary to its own people,” but Mr Grey points out that, by arriving as a tabula rasa, “Blue's only choice was to be human” (Dorsey 2001: 341). This is a neat reversal of racist discourse that claims that racial (or species) lines are profoundly othering and cannot be crossed (furthermore, in a nice albeit minor debunking not merely of racism but speciesism, Mr Grey was initially referring to Marbl, the cat Blue was holding when reclaimed by the mothership, as the first emissary from Earth). This conclusion is a further riff on The Left Hand of Darkness, at the end of which Genly Ai comes to see the hermaphroditic Gethenians as normal and as human, while his colleagues from the Ekumen - locked in single-sex bodies and constantly ready for sex, rather than experiencing sexual readiness on a cyclical basis - seem to him both alien and perverted.

Blue has no choice but to be human. Its people are likely to seem alien to it, as Genly's do to him. Blue tells Morgan, “They wanted a Rosetta Stone, but you can't make a Rosetta Stone if you know only one language . . . Even if I have memories of another life somewhere in here, and they re-activate them, they will not line up in a translation table with the memories I have now. They will both be local grammars, with no way to integrate them” (Dorsey 2001: 316-7). Ironically, Blue becomes not only an emissary from Earth, but rather only an emissary from Earth. Reading The Left Hand of Darkness through Blue's reflections, one wonders whether Genly, who went to Gethen as an adult with his own language, memories, and assumptions about the natural and the normal, will be able to translate across the gap between experiencing the world as unity (Gethen) and as duality (the Ekumen). In A Paradigm of Earth, the experience of different genders and sexualities is less localized, but Blue's inability to be categorized as male or female resonates with the fluidity of genders and sexualities in Morgan's life and household - and in queer theory.

Queer theory focuses not on explaining what it means to be lesbian or gay, but rather on understanding how the categories of homosexual and heterosexual - terms coined only in 1869 and 1892, respectively - came into being and what kinds of material effect these discourses of sexuality have on people's lives. It is thus unsurprising that queer theoretical work on sf has concentrated at least as much on work that appears “straight” or that even seems, on the surface, to have little to say about sexuality as it has on work by lesbian and gay writers or which overtly addresses sexual and gender issues. Just as feminist critiques of sf reveal the workings of sexist and patriarchal discourses within the genre, so queer critiques of sf reveal the workings of hetero-normativity. Heteronormativity presupposes that only heterosexuality is normal and assumes a very limited, hegemonic definition of heterosexuality that works in concert with equally essentialized notions of sex and gender (and of the inherent, “natural” match between biological sex and gender role). Thus heteronormativity has multiple effects: it dismisses as “abnormal” or “perverted” those who do not fit its gender norms, including transsexuals, intersex people, tomboys, “sissies,” and effeminate men; and it severely regulates and disciplines the bodies and behaviors of heterosexually identified people. Heteronormativity can thus be best understood through notions of “good” and “bad” sex (see Rubin 1993), in which “bad” sex can occur on any of a number of axes, including the sex, gender role, race/ethnicity, and age of the partner, as well as numbers of partners, degree of commitment to the relationship, willingness to adhere to social norms, such as marriage, and to avoid non-sanctioned behaviors, such as sex in public or the use of prophylactics, pornography, sex toys, and so on. In other words, heteronormativity does not simply embrace all potential sexual relationships between people of “opposite” sexes; rather, it disallows anything outside a remarkably limited range of behaviors.

Heteronormativity occurs with considerable frequency in sf texts, where breaches of its expectations function as taken-for-granted markers of particular types of culture. For example, when cyberpunk texts want to represent the decadence and emotional emptiness of life in their urban near futures, nonnormative sexualities, along with criminality and violence, mark out and delimit these settings. In William Gibson's “Johnny Mnemonic” (1981), the sleaziness and futuristic degeneracy of the bar scene is marked by the presence on the door of the “Magnetic Dog Sisters,” one black, one white, “but aside from that as nearly identical as cosmetic surgery could make them. They'd been lovers for years . . . I was never quite sure which one had originally been male” (Gibson 1998: 190). In a few brief sentences, Gibson manages to suggest interracial sex, incest (they are nearly identical “sisters”), lesbianism, and transsexuality. In Johnny Mnemonic (Longo 1995), they appear unnamed, transformed into bad guy Ralfi's bodyguards, their degeneracy visually marked by their extreme thinness, bizarre makeup, suggestive costumes, and the film's general use of film noir conventions. Like low-rent hip-hop groupies, they call other women “bitch.” The black one is obviously a man in drag, and the white one licks tongues with Ralfi to emphasize the animalistic, amoral quality of cyberpunk's post-everything sexualities. Both the story and the film use nonnormative sexualities to denote evil, even though the story, unlike the film, provides Molly Millions with a highly nonnormative gender role: she becomes both protagonist and hero, while Johnny is merely the story's motivation and its recorder, a role more commonly reserved for women. The story, then, is ambivalent in its queerness, at once “queering” Molly's - and, by necessity, Johnny's - gender, yet retaining normative sexual conventions as ways of distinguishing good and evil. The film is simply normative. Molly is transformed into a character called Jane, but she does not even have the agency of her namesake in Tarzan the Ape Man (Van Dyke 1932), who mocks her father's authority, rejects the appropriate suitor, and ends up as Tarzan's partner and equal in a new “queer” family with Cheetah the chimp in the role of child.

In addition to questioning representational heteronormativity, queer theory has also begun to critique “homonormativity,” a “politics that does not contest dominant heteronormative assumptions and institutions but upholds and sustains them, while promising the possibility of a semi-mobilized gay constituency and a privatized, de-politicized gay culture anchored in domesticity and consumption” (Duggan 2003: 50). The same-sex marriage issue has been categorized as profoundly homonormative, entrenching rights for predominantly white, predominantly middle-class couples at the expense of everyone else, but particularly the most marginalized and disenfranchised.

The logic of assimilation that creates “good” queer citizens is founded, as Eric O. Clarke (2000) demonstrates, on discourses of subjunctivity (the condition of acting “as if”), in which, in order to acquire equality with their heterosexual peers, lesbian and gay people are required to behave as if they were heterosexual and thus to create relationships based on a heteronormative model, save for the biological sex of the partner. Such a logic of assimilation has complex consequences, both positive and negative. On the one hand, same-sex marriage exerts a symbolic freight which allows lesbian and gay people to be understood as more than superficially “equal” to straight people, indeed, to belong to the nation. On the other hand, as Anna M. Agathangelou et al. ask, “What bodies, desires, and longings must be criminalized and annihilated to produce the good queer subjects, politics, and desires that are being solidified with the emergence of homonormativity?” (Agathangelou et al. 2008: 124) While historically, racist discourses on the part of the colonizer displaced homosexual and nonnormative heterosexual behaviors onto the colonized, who were figured as “sodomites,” more recently these discourses have been reversed and it has been the colonized and the marginalized who have produced their own discourses eliding homosexuality from their midst - as in Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, who insists that homosexuality is a European import and not “natural” or native to Africans. In a similar fashion, predominantly white-run homophobic organizations in the US, such as Focus on the Family, have attempted to convince traditionally liberal African-American voters that gay rights is a “white issue,” thus creating an obviously counterfactual strand of public discourse in which homosexuals are all white and blacks are all heterosexual. At the same time, trenchant critiques of racist and classist practices among parts of the lesbian and gay community have revealed the extent to which working-class lesbians and gay men and queer people of color may be condemned to various forms of social marginalization.

These questions are not simple. Queer theory, operating both to reveal and to oppose heteronormativity, has come into conflict not only with religious fundamentalism and political neoconservatism but also with assimilationist and homonormative politics. This creates a sense of discomfort with queer theory in parts of the lesbian and gay community: after all, if one's greatest desire is to be “normal,” then it is disconcerting to have the value of normalcy questioned from its very foundations. At the same time, much community-formation for lesbians and gays has revolved around coalitions of differences; insofar as queer theory posits a future beyond or “after” gay, it creates discomfort from this perspective also. This leads to the curiously contradictory position assumed by many who claim essential identities: those who believe that they were “born gay,” insist that gayness is not a significant axis of difference and should not prevent them from being recognized as normal, while simultaneously accusing queer theory of “de-gaying” and of removing queer people's essential difference from the straight community by positing fluid sexualities which are unattached to identities.

These issues have also been taken up within sf in a variety of ways. For example, in Joy Parks's “Instinct” (2006), an unhappy lesbian goes to a matchmaking service only to find herself diverted into a queer underground. One might assume this is taking place because the society is repressive, but in this story the opposite is true. Assimilation has produced a society in which there were no real queers: “equal doesn't mean the same. And by the time we figured out what was really going on, we were done for. They finally got it right. All those years of hating us had only made us stronger. But it only took a couple of decades of acceptance to make us disappear” (Parks 2006: 56). Acceptance becomes obliteration; when more than half the population engages in same-sex sexuality, when anyone who wants a sex change can become a nuMan or a nu Woman, something seems to be lost. As the underground lesbian says, “there's no community. We're too fractured. We're everywhere . . . and nowhere. It's a whole new way of being invisible” (Parks 2006: 57). Offered the option to go to the “past” (a recreated community in the wilderness outside the domes in which “everyone” lives), the protagonist chooses not the organic, communal 1970s nor the hip, sexy 1980s nor the domestic, partners-with-children 1990s, but rather the fully repressive 1950s. The flipside of lesbians who want a visible dyke life turns out to be conservatives who want to go back to the good old days and who volunteer to recreate the homophobia of the past. The protagonist slips into femme drag, and heads off to follow her “instincts”: “How can you survive without instincts? Take gaydar, for instance. That was real, you know . . . and you needed it back then. To figure people out. To not get slapped or arrested. Or killed. It made us special” (Parks 2006: 57).

“Instinct” posits an either/or future of assimilation or repression. Either you are different, and thus exist but are persecuted for it, or you are the same, and cease to exist. If “Instinct” can find no way out of this dilemma, what can we bring to it by reading it through queer theory? Of course, since queer theory is a fluid and slippery field, one might have to begin by defining whose version of queer theory one is talking about. However, it seems to me that any reader might question whether “being special” is worth the price of being persecuted or killed when one has a choice; for those of us in the real world who face the material consequences of queerness every day, the issue of choice is a great deal less simple. Many opponents of queer theory assume that its alignment with constructivism means that it assumes that sexuality is a free choice, which is not at all the case. In fact, most scholars in the field have deliberately avoided or refused the question. Asked about whether he thought homosexuality is learned or innate, Foucault replied, “On this question I have absolutely nothing to say. 'No comment,'” and added, when pressed, “It's not my problem, and I don't like talking about things that are not really the object of my work. On this question I have only an opinion; since it is only an opinion, it is without interest” (Foucault 1997: 142). In fact, Foucault also avoids the question for fear his answer would attain “authority” simply because of his reputation, but the very asking of the question suggests a complete failure to understand his work on sexuality, which is genealogical, rather than historical in the usual sense. That is, it specifically eschews the search for origins in favor of more localized effects, patterns of transmission, shifts in discourse, concentrations and dispersions of material effects. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Judith Butler, two of the figures most associated with queer theory, have given similar responses to the question of origins. The question is not interesting in part because it is unanswerable and in part because what is important is what happens once someone has constituted, or has had constituted for them, a sexual identity. Sexuality can only take place, like every aspect of human life, within culture; it is culture that gives meaning to what we are and to what we do. And, in our culture, discourses of normalcy have predominantly come to shape the interpretative habits and skills we bring to bear on manifestations of sexuality. It is thus these discourses which most need to be challenged by sf's power to imagine alternative possibilities for the ways in which we live, and love, in the world. If it takes a television show like Buffy or a novel like A Paradigm of Earth to do that, well, bring on the lesbian, gay, and bisexual vampires, and the queer blue aliens.",,2137953502,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Pearson, Wendy Gay"," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

31. Utopian Studies (Part II: Theory),"The concept of “utopia,” which dates from antiquity, is developed in modes as disparate as fiction, philosophy, theology, epistemology, praxis (as living experiments), political philosophy, and critical theory. Working from the perspective of utopian studies, this introductory overview is almost exclusively limited to consideration of utopian literatures in English. It privileges the concept of “utopia” as expressed through fiction, as well as utopian theory by scholars whose fields of inquiry include both sf and utopia. Following a short discussion of the emergence of utopian studies as a contemporary academic discipline, I will offer a sampling of major literary utopias since the 1500s, concentrating on their historically situated themes, before discussing some major political and philosophical utopian concepts. I will consider several major works of recent utopian critical and literary theory, and close with a few thoughts on the problem of the distinction between utopian thought and praxis, and, by extension, the problem of definition vis-à-vis utopia.

Utopian studies - as distinguished from intertextual fictional debates over the politics of various utopian visions and from sociopolitical debates over utopia - might be dated roughly from the 1960s, when there was a major expansion of potential fields of academic study. This coincided with several other developments that influenced the development of utopian studies, including the growing acceptance of cultural studies as a discipline; a growth explosion in college education and, by extension, its unprecedented accessibility to groups not historically represented in academe who brought new areas of interest to scholarship; and, finally, the revitalization of interest in thought-experiments, such as utopias, by the youth culture of the mid- to late 1960s. Utopian studies' status as a thriving academic discipline coincides roughly with the development of the Society for Utopian Studies, a scholarly research group founded in 1975, which describes itself as “an international, interdisciplinary association devoted to the study of utopianism in all its forms, with a particular emphasis on literary and experimental utopias” (Society for Utopian Studies 2007). While “utopian studies has undergone a dramatic growth in the last three decades,” it “remains a relatively new field of academic study” (Levitas 1990: 156).

The journal of the Society for Utopian Studies, Utopian Studies, put the field on the contemporary scholarly map. Its articles often develop theses out of the study of sf. Likewise, the journal Science Fiction Studies, founded in 1973 - which had a similarly galvanizing effect on scholarship addressing sf - often includes considerations of works that are generally considered to be, generically, utopias. Thus there has been, from the emergence and consolidation of sf studies and utopian studies, considerable cross-fertilization in terms of texts studied and of scholars engaged in both disciplines.

Most definitions of the literary utopia begin with the founding work of the genre, Sir Thomas More's Utopia (1516), first translated into English from Latin in 1551 by Ralph Robynson. More coined the term “utopia,” which is a derivation of the word “outopia,” meaning “no place.” More's Utopia, then, is specifically not a eutopia, an exclusively “good place,” but is rather an often satirical rendering of a non-place that refers to, but does not adhere to, the concept of utopia as a completely idealized space, such as, for Western Christianity, heaven. Although More's Utopia includes a consideration of religion as part of its structure, it is not commonly read as a blueprint for religious beliefs but rather as a critique of existing religious practices. While utopia is commonly thought of as the perfect place, More's Utopia, as a “no place,” does not represent his idea of the ultimately ideal, attainable place, but serves as a blank slate upon which he inscribes a world that is intended to estrange the contemporary reader from their conditions of existence, thus allowing them to see their own world in a new light. In other words, More's Utopia is political satire in the sf mode of cognitive estrangement (see Suvin 1979). Lyman Tower Sargent defines the literary utopia as “a non-existent society described in considerable detail and normally located in time and space” (Sargent 1994: 9). Other influential early modern utopias include Sir Francis Bacon's The New Atlantis (1627), James Harrington's political essay The Commonwealth of Oceana (1656), and Margaret Cavendish's The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing-World (1666), all of which feature, in a mode characterized by earnestness rather than More's satire, elaborations of worlds that refer to their contemporary historical moments by positing corrective versions of existing religious, property, gender, and/or political relations. In fact, these last three works more properly fit the definition of the category of utopia called eutopian, because the worlds that they describe are specifically “good” places. Both utopias and eutopias are found in early modern literature: the fiction or tract writer's decision to depict utopia as either a “no place” or an alternative social blueprint depends on the rhetorical form. Generally, More's satirical mode gives way to utopian Enlightenment idealism in the late seven-teenth century. This idealism extends through the Romantic era and includes critical feminist works which flourished in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The eutopia or “positive utopia” is “a non-existent society described in considerable detail and normally located in time and space that the author intended a contemporaneous reader to view as considerably better than the society in which that reader lived” (Sargent 1994: 9). It became less popular as the historical conditions conducive to unreserved idealism regarding the transformative powers of science-as-progress faded. As Ruth Levitas and Lucy Sargisson note, “Utopia is not dead, but the kind of utopianism that is holistic, social, future-located, committed, and linked to the present by some identifiable narrative of change - a kind of collective optimism of the intellect as well as the will - is culturally problematic” (Levitas and Sargisson 2003: 15). Thus, by the middle of the nineteenth century, the idea that a specifically “good” place might be achieved through human agency under the correct social conditions, as posited by Bacon, Harrington, and Cavendish, no longer seems plausible.

Eighteenth-century literary utopias and utopian political treatises tended, unsurprisingly, to focus on the importance of reason, specifically the applicability of reason to social governance and the health of the social body. Plato's Republic (c. 360 BC), with its focus on good governance as a means of producing and maintaining “just” subjects and social conditions, became an important text for the genre during an era marked by literary and politico-philosophical neoclassicism. Samuel Johnson's Rasselas (1759), a meditation upon the problem of governmentally mandated “utopia” versus the realization of utopia as the individual's prerogative, is one of the most well-known eighteenth-century utopias in this tradition. Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726) also takes up the theme of the problem of governmentally mandated “utopian” states, although in a radically different prose style. Swift's satirical representations of extreme versions of the governed “good life,” from visions of the impossibly deluded society to the impossibly “reasonable” philosopher's society, prefigure Johnson's impossibly idle feudalistic enclave, the Happy Valley. However, unlike Swift, Johnson finds the potential for utopian hope in reason: the prisoners of the (un)Happy Valley are rescued by reason, in the form of a wise scholar. In Swift's vision, scholars are complacent to the point of somnambulism: reason, like anything else taken to extremes, fails as a form of governance for a utopia. Of course, the rejection of extremes is in itself an important theme for Enlightenment-era political philosophers.

Feminism is seriously thematized in several eighteenth-century utopias, reflecting the variety of new Enlightenment-inspired discourses on the problem of women's subjugation. In works such as Sarah Scott's A Description of Millenium Hall and the Country Adjacent (1762) and Lady Mary Hamilton's Munster Village (1778), intricate social structures are described wherein women, in a semi-sequestered state, are allowed the opportunity to develop as intellectuals and workers: they also enjoy sensual pleasures such as good food and drink. A major theme shared by feminist utopias of this period is the importance of women's education. In feminist political philosophy and feminist utopian novels, the most popular argument made on behalf of a woman's right to education was its inherently reasonable utility for both sexes. Eighteenth-century feminist utopias provided influential and moving portraits of how radically women could improve their lot if they were granted equal status as thinking subjects.

Mid- to late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century utopias took a critical turn, abandoning the idealism generally characteristic of the eighteenth century. These utopias differ from later “critical utopias,” which are “intended [for] a contemporaneous reader to view as better than contemporary society but with difficult problems that the described society may or may not be able to solve and which [take] a critical view of the Utopian genre” (Sargent 1994: 9). Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (1888) and Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland (1915) are classic utopian, as opposed to eutopian or critical utopian, texts, because they both thematize the potentially transformative and liberatory powers of technology in a “good place” that is also explicitly “no place.” From parthenogenesis to more efficient rail systems, technology - in the right hands, of course - is a workable means toward a more sustainable, humane, and independent world. Such thought-experiments are often characterized as lacking in writerly craft: they are generally received as highly didactic works that often feature a protagonist alien to the utopian society, who must be schooled in the ways of the “good,” alien space. This protagonist serves a cognitively estranging function, as his or her reactions of delight and disbelief refer the reader to the fallen contemporary world from which the protagonist has traveled. Whereas the eutopia tends to be a self-contained and totalizing portrait of another world, utopias of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries highlight this dialogue between the denizens of utopia and the unenlightened visitor. This is an important distinction because it signals an increasingly disenchanted worldview: these utopias do not encompass or constitute The World, but are rather one spatio-temporal zone located on the perimeter of a fallen contemporary world.

The thematization of the contemporary political sphere via its estrangement through utopian visions of various types is a major defining feature of literary utopias. Sociopolitical and philosophical treatises on the possibility of utopian ways of living are an integral part of the history of the literary utopia - indeed, generically utopian literary works such as William Morris's News from Nowhere (1890) serve to blur the literary/sociopolitical distinction, as it is an explicit response, from a socialist theorist, lecturer, and novelist, to the political problems presented by Looking Backward. Bellamy's technophilic, utilitarian utopia prescribes, essentially, an approach to the tools of the industrial revolution that maximizes worker efficiency and thus, by extension, leisure time in which to enjoy bourgeois trappings and pursuits. However, the novel reinscribes class stratifications and does not address the alienating effects of industrialized labor. In stark contrast, News from Nowhere presumes labor's pleasurable function in the formation and sustenance of a socialist utopian state. Morris represents work as pleasure: specifically, he breaks down the distinction between work and leisure time by representing forms of labor that are shared and unalienated (although, notably, he retains the gendered division of labor). Both novel and socialist polemic, this popular and influential book opens up the question of sociopolitical writings on utopia.

Gilman's Herland is the most famous feminist utopian novel of this period, and serves in some important ways as a rejoinder to both Bellamy's and Morris's politically insufficient utopian visions. Gilman demonstrates that a genuinely utopian vision must include, in a rigorous manner and as a centrally thematized problem, serious consideration of the needs of the vast majority of the population (that is to say, women and children) in order to be truly utopian. By prioritizing issues around children, motherhood, women's intellectual development, and their physical comfort and capacities, Gilman shows us, via the device of a group of disbelieving men, how estranged from the ideal of gender equality her readers really are.

The idea of feminist philosophical and literary utopias as forms of praxis highlights once again the sense in which utopianism (as practice) and utopias are inter-implicated. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were famously hostile to much utopian sociopolitical thought, deeming it ultimately inadequate as a form of praxis. Socialist utopian blueprints, such as those found in the writings of Charles Fourier and Robert Owen, were found problematic because they did not adequately concern themselves with the problem of the revolutionary transition to the socialist state, but rather confined their field of inquiry primarily to idealist visions of the post-revolutionary socialist state. The “utopian blueprint” thus elided what, for Marx and Engels, was a historical event to be effected by the proletariat via revolution, and which could not, by its very nature, be predicted in specific terms of form and long-term outcome. Moreover, the “utopian blueprint” is predicated on the dreams and desires of the historically situated individual doing the “blueprinting,” whereas the attained socialist state in its particulars would reflect the needs and desires of an unalienated proletariat - and nobody, of course, could know what those needs and desires would be since the conditions for their existence were unrealized. Marx and Engels appreciated certain aspects of socialist utopian visions but, because they were set forth as very specific sets of practices, they were not seen as a viable form of socialist critique.

Utopia was reconsidered by a later group of Marxist theorists, notably early twentieth-century exiles from fascist Europe, as a useful epistemological category. I will focus here on the work of Herbert Marcuse, whose resurrection of Utopia-as-epistemology is very influential. Drawing on Sigmund Freud's theory regarding the necessary relationship between repression of the pleasure principle and the maintenance of civilization, Marcuse argues that, although it is indeed true that the pleasure principle must to some extent be repressed in order to maintain civilized relations between people, it is also the case that, under the capitalist mode of production, the amount of labor required of the individual is excessive. This excess is artificially produced by the mode of production, which exacts labor in excess of actual demand (excess labor leads to excess, or surplus, repression), and artificially maintained by the mode of production through the promotion of false needs, which the laborer willingly attempts to acquire by laboring in excess of actual demand. Therefore, Marcuse reasons, the Marxist utopian objective is the release of the worker from artificially high amounts of labor, which would then result in a rearrangement of human desires that would eliminate false needs.

As in Fourier and Owen's visions, the conditions for utopia are predicated on the attainment of unalienated labor. Unlike Fourier or Owen, however, Marcuse is skeptical about the possibility of imagining a socialist utopia in its particulars, although he does speculate on the necessary conditions for its development. Like Marx and Engels, he recognizes that the historical conditions do not exist in which one might usefully speculate on what our false needs would be replaced with, much less what unalienated labor might look like. He does, however, insist on the need to reconceptualize and reutilize technological advances in the interests of minimizing the amount of labor necessary to sustain civilization.

Many theorists and social pioneers have attempted to create the conditions necessary for minimally repressive work and work conditions - and, by extension, a space in which unalienated social relations might emerge. Although these efforts necessarily take place in a marginalized relation to the dominant culture, and thus are susceptible to the development of their own sets of false hopes and alienations, they are nonetheless important manifestations of another area of inquiry for utopian studies: the intentional community or commune. Many intentional communities have been inspired by utopian socialist writers. Fourier and Owen, in the early nineteenth century, both inspired the development of communal living based on such principles as the abolition of sexist divisions of labor; the development of as-much-as-possibly self-sustaining living and work environments; the abolition of most private-property ownership; and respect for the land, among others. More than a century later, B.F. Skinner's utopian/sf Walden Two (1948) inspired the development of intentional communities, most successfully Twin Oaks, which has much in common, in its principles, with Fourier's and Owen's utopian visions (but significantly not all - Fourier is the most vociferous and intelligent critic of women's sexual and intellectual subjugation). Twentieth- and twenty-first-century experiments in communal living are inspired by similar social justice ideals, with an increased focus on the problems of sexism, racism, and classism.

A consideration of “critical utopias” completes my survey of major utopian works. The critical utopia, which emerged as a dominant form of utopian writing during the 1960s and 1970s, tends to reflect the sociopolitical concerns of an era characterized by demands for change in the areas of global exploitation (the “Third World problem,” ecological exploitation), gender inequality, race inequality, and class antagonism. These novels “reject utopia as a blueprint while preserving it as a dream,” they “dwell on the conflict between the originary world and the utopian society opposed to it so that the process of social change is more directly articulated,” and they “focus on the continuing presence of difference and imperfection within the utopian society itself and thus render more recognizable and dynamic alternatives” (Moylan 1986: 10-11). Such explicitly critical works of this era include novels by Suzy McKee Charnas, Samuel R. Delany, Ursula K. Le Guin, Marge Piercy, and Joanna Russ.

Further discussion of the critical utopia requires that we distinguish it from the dystopia, which does not retain the same tension between the possibility of utopia and the dark world-vision it presents. Dystopias reject both blueprint and dream. For example, Octavia E. Butler's The Parable of the Sower (1992) and The Parable of the Talents (1998) are, like much of her fiction, dystopian inasmuch as they present worst-case-scenario futures - proto-fascist, racist, and sexist US police states and ecological crisis - as the backdrop for her characters' struggles for survival. On the other hand, Butler's work does not reject the possibility of social change, although it must come slowly and through the grassroots efforts of (often problematically) diverse individuals. There does not appear to be a critical consensus regarding the usefulness of making a distinction between critical utopias and dystopias, which share many of the same characteristics. In a provisional way one might define dystopias as critical utopias that contain the least promise for the change or growth of the posited future or parallel space. Exemplary dystopias - that is to say, utopias that reject both the blueprint and the dream - include George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1985). However, we run into the problem of definition again, as both Orwell and Atwood append faint but definite glimmers of hope to their dystopian visions.

The critical utopia explicitly rejects the totalized, blueprint ideal society and presents us instead with a set of social problems and a spatio-temporal context or contexts in which they might usefully be addressed. They do not claim to have The Answer, as in the carefully mapped utopian alternate universe of a Bellamy, Morris, or Gilman. Instead, they postulate possible answers. Thus, for instance, Delany's Triton (1976) posits the coexistence of a variety of modes and means of living viably, from street-level anonymous subsistence to highly organized group housing arrangements of varying degrees of affluence. In Charnas's The Furies (1994), women occupy a wide variety of viable splinter groups, from those who would keep men enslaved and used only for reproductive purposes to those who work toward establishing (a long-shattered) harmony between the sexes. Although critical utopias and dystopias certainly made their appearance before the second half of the twentieth century, utopian fiction from the 1950s onwards tends toward these varieties.

I will now turn to some important recent theoretical work on the conjunction of utopia and sf, most notably Fredric Jameson's Archaeologies of the Future (2005). Here, like Jameson, I wish to displace “the inquiry away from content . . . and substitute the question, What difficulties must be overcome in imagining or representing Utopia? for the seemingly more urgent investigation of the nature of Utopian desire and the substance of its hope” (Jameson 2005: 84). Jameson addresses the formal generic properties of a formidable variety of utopian texts, punctuating this “formalist approach” (Jameson 2005: 85) with an inquiry into the theoretical challenges that utopia presents. Specifically, he is concerned with the problem of utopian desire, because, as much as Jameson grapples with the meaning of utopia through available interpretive devices, none of them can precisely answer. Utopia, as Jameson theorizes it, is the expression of or collective yearning for that which cannot be fulfilled - in other words, it is a desire, so its representation is always highly contingent and its realization necessarily impossible.

The problematic nature of the representation of utopia is a standard feature of literature on the subject: Louis Marin points out, in his Utopics: spatial play (1973), that the etymology of “utopia” brings up the problem of its radical instability, that the Greek ou or no, and topos or place, combine to identify utopia, traditionally defined as a “good place” as at one and the same time necessarily a “no place.” But it is because of this instability that Marin sees utopia as a useful theoretical device, because utopias typically represent the tension between a fallen now and the “good place” that might come out of a critical recognition of its fallen state. Marin notes that utopias can be useful indices of how un-utopian our world really is, and that furthermore they can, in their degenerate versions, allow us to see how our sense of historical awareness is crippled when we provide ourselves with safe, unreal no-place zones in which to play out our paltry fantasies (his famous example of this phenomenon is Disneyland).

Carl Freedman (2000) maps out how Ernst Bloch's The Principle of Hope (1959) (for Bloch, hope is an essential component of the human psyche) provides us with a useful means by which to read sf's nova, or newly fabulated spaces, as containing critical utopias - that is to say, not self-contained eutopian visions but critically rigorous expressions of how we might imagine utopia's potential political power: it “is the transformation of actuality into utopia that constitutes the practical end of utopian critique and the ultimate object of utopian hope . . . the cognitive rationality (at least in literary effect) of science fiction allows utopia to emerge as more fully itself, genuinely and critically transformative. In this way, the dynamic of science fiction can on one level be identified with the hope principle itself” (Freedman 2000: 69).

Jameson describes the transformative potential inherent in the no-place/good-place that is utopia as disruption. The desire called Utopia has a potential source of gratification - the problem that desire-gratification attempts are inevitably debased and impossible, according to the Freudian/Lacanian formulation, is solved by Jameson's reconsideration of the “formalist approach,” which releases Utopia from a debased gratification attempt: “it might therefore be better to follow an aesthetic paradigm and to assert that not only the production of the irresolvable contradiction is the fundamental process, but that we must imagine some form of gratification inherent in this very confrontation with pessimism and the impossible” (Jameson 2005: 84). Thus, since the desire called Utopia is actually a desire-aesthetic, its tension-moment is therefore something to be not cured or repressed, but rather critically dwelt in.

This observation brings us back to the recent reevaluation of the eutopia as a potentially critical theoretical apparatus. In “The Problem of the 'Flawed Utopia,'” Sargent describes eutopia as an act: we “must commit eutopia knowing that it is not perfect and that, like the ideal polis in Plato's Republic, it contains within it the seeds of its own destruction. We must commit eutopia again and again because . . . not believing in the possibility of betterment, however flawed, condemns us to live in someone else's vision of a better life, perhaps one forced on us . . . denying eutopia ensures that we live in dystopia” (Sargent 2003: 230). Likewise, Darko Suvin concludes, in his “Theses on Dystopia 2001,” that all the “variants of dystopian-cum-eutopian fiction” he discusses “pivot not only on individual self-determination but centrally on collective self-management enabling and guaranteeing personal freedom. Whoever is not interested in this horizon will not be interested in them. And vice versa” (Suvin 2003: 200). Thus, it seems as though we have come full circle, from the naïve articulation of the totalizing eutopia and its rejection by subsequent thinkers, to a new recognition of eutopia's liberatory potential as a concept/practice.

In conclusion, this elision of concept as practice, or praxis, is, as we have seen, not a new conceptual move. Indeed, it begs a question central to defining utopia: where does utopia-as-social-theory leave off and utopia-as-literary-content begin? Suvin (1988) provides a definition of utopian fiction that addresses this question and also presents us with a description of the relationship between utopian fiction and sf. Although utopian studies scholars might not be particularly gratified by Suvin's characterization of utopian fiction as a subgenre of sf, it seems an appropriate end-point in the context of this volume: “utopian fiction is not only, historically, one of the roots of SF, it is also . . . one of its forms . . . Utopian fiction is the socio-political subgenre of SF, it is social-science-fiction or SF restricted to the field of socio-political relationships or to socio-political constructs understood as crucial for the destiny of people” (Suvin 1988: 38).",,2137959474,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Davis Rogan, Alcena Madeline"," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

33. Science Fiction (Part II: Disciplinary and Theoretical Approaches),"Literary and cultural historians describe science fiction (SF) as the premiere narrative form of modernity because authors working in this genre extrapolate from Enlightenment ideals and industrial practices to imagine how educated people using machines and other technologies might radically change the material world. This kind of future-oriented technoscientific speculation lends itself to social and political speculation as well. While authors working in other literary modes can represent the past and present from new perspectives, only those allied with speculative fiction show us how intervening into the material world can change human relations and generate new futures as well. Thus SF enables authors to dramatize widespread cultural hopes and fears about new technoscientific formations as they emerge at specific historical moments.

The history of SF is very much bound up with the history of modern technoscientific development and the proliferation of writing that accompanied it. By means of the first scientific journals, scholars associated with the scientific academies of seventeenth-century France and Great Britain disseminated new ideas about the quantifiable nature of the material world and the importance of human agents within that world. By the eighteenth century such ideas had become central to the philosophical writings of Immanuel Kant and David Hume and the socio-political treatises of Adam Smith and Voltaire. These ideas inspired the public imagination as well. This was particularly apparent in books such as Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727), periodicals such as Eliza Haywood's The Female Spectator (1744-46), and natural histories such as René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire Naturelle des Insects (1734-42). While books and periodicals introduced scientific ideas to the newly literate middle class, natural histories inspired readers to become amateur scientists themselves by applying close observation skills to the world around them.

The late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries also saw the publication of the first proto-science fiction stories. The authors of these stories were often science enthusiasts who engaged new scientific ideas in their fiction. For example, Voltaire's passion for physics led to the creation of a fully functional laboratory at Château de Cirey and the 1752 publication of Micromégas, a fantastic voyage story in which human scientist-explorers learn about galactic physics from a Jovian space traveler whom they encounter at the North Pole. In 1818 British author Mary Shelley drew upon her reading in pre-Darwinian evolutionary theory and her experience with public demonstrations of galvanism to create Frankenstein, which follows the tragic adventures of an isolated young scientist who uses electricity in a misguided attempt to create a new race of beings that will worship him. Despite their apparent differences, Voltaire and Shelley's stories both insist that science can yield great rewards as long as it is practiced according to the established methods of the scientific community. They also mark the emergence of SF's two oldest archetypes: the heroic scientist-explorer who shares knowledge with his intellectual brethren and the mad scientist who makes disastrous decisions that wreak havoc.

The next generation of speculative fiction writers turned their attention to what would become the central interest of SF: the creation of machines that could transform both the material and social worlds. This new interest emerged at the height of the Industrial Revolution, when steam-powered technologies enabled new modes of locomotion and new methods of production. These developments fostered the proliferation of new trade routes, factories, and urban spaces. They also fostered the rise of a new professional: the engineer. Engineering schools, including the National School of Bridges and Highways in France and Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute in the U.S., first opened their doors at the turn of the nineteenth century; by the mid-nineteenth century graduates of these schools could join specialized organizations dedicated to civil, mechanical, and mining engineering. While engineering was an overwhelmingly masculine profession, in the late nineteenth century technical institutes began granting degrees to the female students who would go on to create the discipline of scientific home management, or domestic engineering.

New technologies and professions were central to the speculative stories that authors on both sides of the Atlantic published in the nineteenth century. These authors conveyed their ideas about the future of industrial society by updating older fantastic narrative traditions. The European leaders of this experiment were Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. Like Voltaire before him, Verne used the extraordinary voyage to spark a sense of wonder in readers regarding the marvels of the physical universe. However, he updated this story type in 1867's From the Earth to the Moon, 1871's A Journey to the Center of the Earth, and 1872's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by extrapolating from contemporary transportation technologies to show how humans (rather than aliens) might travel to exotic locales on the Earth and amongst the stars. In Great Britain, Wells used the future war story - a narrative form often employed by government officials to argue for increased spending on war technologies - to show how submarines, airplanes, and bombs might herald the end of war altogether. This is particularly evident in 1903's “The Last Ironclads,” 1908's The War in the Air, and 1914's The World Set Free, where warring nation-states destroy themselves by underestimating new military technologies, thereby paving the way for the emergence of peaceful, scientifically managed global civilizations. In the stories of both Verne and Wells, the success of new technocultural endeavors depends on the action of a new technocultural hero: the creative engineer who works for the good of all people, rather than the benefit of any individual person, business, or nation.

The principles of creative engineering were even more central to the technological utopias of American authors Edward Bellamy and Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Bellamy's 1888 novel Looking Backward 2000-1887 depicts a future America reorganized along lines later associated with the Fordist factory, with all work parceled out amongst specially trained individuals. In contrast to the often overworked and underpaid factory workers of his own day, however, Bellamy imagined that the citizens of America 2000 who volunteered for menial labor would be rewarded with drastically reduced hours and that all workers would enjoy high pay, abundant goods, and early retirement at the age of 45. In a similar vein, the female citizens of Gilman's 1915 Herland enjoy unprecedented living standards because their wide-scale application of the principles of domestic engineering transform their hostile tropical land into a fertile paradise. They also extend the scientific management of the home to the scientific management of people, combining eugenics with education to create perfectly adjusted children. Thus Bellamy and Gilman built upon the utopian tradition extending back to Sir Thomas More by demonstrating how new and better societies might be created not just by the application of rational thought, but also by the application of rational industrial processes.

The first four decades of the twentieth century marked the consolidation of engineering as the premiere profession of the modern era. They also marked the height of excitement about engineering in the public imagination, especially as it was expressed in the philosophy of technocracy, a pseudo-populist movement that emerged in reaction to the Great Depression and that, at its height, boasted over half a million followers. Led by engineer Howard Scott and the professors of Columbia University's Industrial Engineering department, technocrats advocated the creation of a scientifically educated and technically skilled populace whose best and brightest would naturally rise to the top. This technoscientific elite would apply scientific and engineering principles to political and economic problems, thereby mitigating the woes of the Great Depression and laying the foundation for a utopian, post-scarcity society.

This period also saw the consolidation of SF as a distinct genre complete with its own literary community, publishing outlets, and stylistic conventions. The birth of genre SF is associated with the founding of Amazing Stories in 1926 and Astounding Stories in 1930. These two magazines - printed on the cheap wood-pulp paper that would give this period of SF history its name - were the first dedicated solely to speculative fiction. While authors, editors, and fans worked collaboratively to establish SF, one man is generally recognized as the father of the genre: Luxembourg-American author, inventor, and technocrat Hugo Gernsback. As the first editor of Amazing Stories, Gernsback developed three rules to ensure that speculative fiction would get readers excited about science and technology: “good” SF would be organized around a prophetic vision of the technoscientific future; it would didactically explain how that future came to be; and it would do so in an entertaining way, with approximately 25 percent of each SF narrative dedicated to science and technology and 75 percent dedicated to adventure. These rules inform Gernsback's own writing, most notably in 1911's Ralph 124C 41+: A Romance of the Year 2660. Like other utopias, Gernsback's is comprised of dialog between a native of the utopia in question (here, the world-famous superscientist Ralph 124C) and a naïve visitor who stands in for the reader (Ralph's love interest, Alice 212B). But Gernsback departed from the staid utopian tradition by framing his characters' conversations about the marvels of New York City 2660 with action sequences featuring avalanches, invisible assailants, and battles in outer space.

The elements that Gernsback added to the utopian narrative tradition - depictions of scientists and engineers as action heroes, the celebration of fantastic gadgets, and planet-spanning adventures - became central to the pulpera space opera. The two authors who perfected this sub-genre were Edmund Hamilton and E.E. “Doc” Smith. In the linked Interstellar Patrol stories which ran from 1928 to 1930 and stand-alone tales such as 1934's “Thundering Worlds,” Hamilton imagines far-off futures where humans create intergalactic technocracies while battling with rogue stars, invading aliens, and even the death of their own sun. Meanwhile, Smith's 1928-63 Skylark and 1934-48 Lensman series follow the adventures of a human technoscientific elite who ventures into space only to learn that they are key to the outcome of billion-year-old battles between good and evil. Unlike Gernsback before them, neither Hamilton nor Smith spent much time explaining how their characters created their technocivilizations. However, what science they did include tended to be relatively accurate. Most importantly, the triumphant tone of much space opera neatly conveyed the technoscientific optimism central to early SF.

Technocratic ideals also permeated pulp-era thought-variant stories, which were driven by speculative ideas rather than gadgets. This is particularly apparent in Stanley G. Weinbaum's “The Adaptive Ultimate,” which updated the Frankenstein narrative for the modern scientific era. Weinbaum's 1935 story follows the adventures of two scientists who develop a serum based on insect hormones that enables wounded organisms to heal themselves. After serious ethical debate, the overly enthusiastic scientists decide to skip standard testing protocols and inject the serum into a dying young woman. When she turns into an amoral creature bent on conquering the world, Weinbaum's scientists recognize that they cannot simply, as Victor Frankenstein did, reject their creation. Instead, they take responsibility for their actions and contain the threat of the young woman, thereby transforming themselves from mad to heroic scientists. The principles of technocracy were also fundamental to John W. Campbell's 1939 “Forgetfulness,” which takes place on a far-future Earth where humans live in modest glass domes situated on the outskirts of ruined megacities. At the end of the story readers learn that these humans have not lost control of science and technology, but have actively chosen telepathic over technoscientific ways of being to avoid repeating their war-torn history. Thus Campbell's protagonists apply engineering techniques to the problem of human history and gain control over evolution itself.

The middle decades of the twentieth century seemed to epitomize the technocratic ideals of the pulp-era SF community. The new connections forged with industry and government during World War II led to a period of record growth for American science in the Cold War era. Much of this growth occurred in the two areas of research seen as key to national defense: atomic energy and space exploration. The expansion of defense spending, combined with the consumer demands of a newly affluent public, spurred the rapid development of American technology as well, especially as it pertained to the creation of automated machines designed to run complex industrial operations. Indeed, while atomic energy and space exploration research promised to transform the American future, automation seemed poised to transform America in the present as factory workers began working with robots and computer experts swelled the ranks of the technoscientific elite. The technocratic transformation of labor extended to women's work as well. During World War II women were encouraged to express their patriotism by working in laboratories and factories while men went overseas to fight. Afterward, they were encouraged to continue serving their country by applying their technoscientific expertise to life in the suburbs. In particular, women were expected to prepare their homes for the possibility of nuclear attack and foster family togetherness through the judicious consumption of domestic goods. Thus men and women alike were figured as essential to the United States's development as a technocultural world leader.

Much like science, SF experienced a Golden Age in the 1940s and 1950s. Prior to World War II, SF authors were often dismissed for writing about impossible sciences and technologies. Afterward, they were hailed as visionary prophets and invited to consult with entertainment, industry, and government leaders alike. This period also marked the appearance of the first SF anthologies, the beginning of the SF paperback novel trade, and the explosion of SF storytelling across radio, film, and television. Even with all these changes, magazines remained the heart of the SF community. The most important magazine editor of this period was physicist-turned-pulp SF author John W. Campbell, who took over Astounding Science Fiction (formerly Astounding Stories) in 1939. Campbell believed that SF was an important part of the larger scientific discourse already changing history. As such, he insisted that authors write stories that were logically extrapolated from current knowledge about the physical world and that they carefully consider the impact of new sciences and technologies on society. While Campbell's editorial vision dominated SF for years to come, two other editors made equally lasting contributions to the development of the genre: Anthony Boucher, who co-founded the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1949, and H.L. Gold, who launched Galaxy Science Fiction in 1950. Boucher was a respected mystery writer and translator who published experimental stories of high literary quality, while Gold was a fantasy and comic book writer who excelled at fostering socially satiric SF. Taken together, these three editors shaped SF as a modern genre.

The new story types that proliferated throughout this period underscore the literary and cultural maturity of Golden Age SF. This is particularly evident in the future histories of Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov. Heinlein's future history stories (originally published in Astounding between 1930 and 1960, then reprinted in The Past Through Tomorrow in 1967) tell the tale of a determined humanity that automates travel on Earth and then, over the course of the next three millennia, goes on to colonize the stars. Meanwhile, Asimov's future history sequence (including the stories collected in 1950's I, Robot, the Robot novels published between 1947 and 1958) predicts that humans' robotic creations will eventually become their caretakers, fostering the flame of civilization in even the darkest of times. With their emphasis on galaxy-spanning futures populated by sleek space ships and autonomous robots, such Golden Age stories were clear successors to their pulp-era counterparts. However, both Heinlein and Asimov dramatized technoscientific change in ways that spoke to the lived experience of mid-century readers, treating it as something that comes from the collaborative effort of scientists, soldiers, businesspeople, and government officials and that provokes both hope and fear in the individuals living through ages of wonder that are not necessarily of their own making.

While Heinlein and Asimov used future histories to celebrate technocratic ideals, other Golden Age authors used other SF story forms to critically assess the relations of science, technology, and society. The most significant of these was the nuclear-war narrative. In Judith Merril's 1950 novel Shadow on the Hearth, Walter Miller's 1960 novel A Canticle for Leibowitz, and Nevil Shute's 1957 novel On the Beach, nuclear war is not - as popular thinking then held something that can be either limited or won. Instead, even the most minor atomic explosions reverberate through space and time, destroying families, plunging nations into savagery, and wiping out humanity altogether. Meanwhile, the media landscape story - which explored worlds dominated by images of advertising and the popular arts - seemed to be a relative lighthearted mockery of American consumerism. And yet short stories such as Fritz Leiber's 1949 “The Girl with the Hungry Eyes” and Ann Warren Griffith's 1953 “Captive Audience,” as well as Frederik Pohl and C.M. Kornbluth's 1953 novel The Space Merchants, turn out to be almost as frightening as their atomic-themed counterparts. As media landscape authors insisted time and time again, the mid-century tendency to protect corporations at the expense of consumers might well lead to the rise of a surveillance state where individuals would be stripped of their civil rights and required to purchase indiscriminately in the name of national security.

Both science and SF developed in new directions in the 1960s and 1970s. One of the most important events influencing the former was the institutional ascendancy of the social sciences. Throughout this period sociologists, psychologists, and anthropologists sought to legitimate their work by emphasizing the scientific nature of their subject matter (the quantifiable world of social relations) and methodologies (including the techniques of statistical inquiry and group research). These efforts were so successful - and so popular with students looking for socially relevant classes - that even the most conservative technical institutes made room for social science courses in their curricula. But social scientists were not the only new players in the technoscientific arena. Supported by Cold War legislation that guaranteed educational funds for talented youth, women flooded science, math, and engineering departments in record numbers. When these women found themselves blocked from graduate school and the best professional careers, they took action. Leading scientists joined the National Organization for Women and led the first class-action lawsuits against sexual discrimination in public university hiring practices. Such efforts led to the ratification of the 1972 Educational Amendment Acts, whose Title IX guaranteed equal pay for men and women working in higher education, while banning sex discrimination in all federally funded educational programs.

The initial challenge to speculative writing in this period came from a group of transatlantic authors and editors associated with what would eventually be called New Wave SF. The New Wave movement coalesced around Michael Moorcock's New Worlds magazine in Great Britain in the mid-1960s and debuted in the U.S. with the publication of Harlan Ellison's Dangerous Visions anthology in 1967 and Judith Merril's England Swings SF anthology in 1968. New Wave authors maintained that the characters, story types, and technocratic ideals of earlier SF were no longer adequate for dramatizing life in the modern world. As such, it was necessary to make SF new by turning from the hard to the soft sciences and exchanging stories about outer space for those focusing on the inner spaces of individuals and their societies. Other challenges came from the scores of new women writers who joined SF during this period. Feminist author-critics Joanna Russ, Pamela Sargent, and Samuel R. Delany all readily acknowledged that women had always written speculative fiction. But they also maintained that even the best SF remained trapped in “galactic suburbia”: an imaginary space of dazzling technoscientific extrapolation where, oddly enough, social relations still looked like those of 1950s middle-class America. Accordingly, feminist writers called for their comrades to rethink their aesthetic practices and fulfill the Campbellian ideals of good SF by writing fiction that complicated mainstream notions about the future of scientific, social, and sexual relations.

Although they sometimes differed in their ideas about the relations of modern SF to its generic traditions, both New Wave and feminist SF authors used their chosen genre to explore how humans might grapple with alienation from themselves and their worlds. This is particularly apparent in the natural and urban disaster novels of British New Wave author J.G. Ballard. Ballard's 1962 novel The Drowned World imagines that humans might greet apocalypse (caused, in this case, by solar radiation that transforms Europe and North America into boiling lagoons) as an opportunity to give up technoscientific mastery and embrace devolution. Meanwhile, his 1973 Crash explores a near future where people come to terms with their media-saturated world by restaging and starring in famous car accidents. Much like Ballard, American author Harlan Ellison used the setting of a radically transformed world to explore the inner space of individuals and their societies. This is particularly apparent in Ellison's infamous 1967 short story “A Boy and His Dog,” which explores the impact of nuclear war on the nuclear family. In its broad outline, Ellison's story seems much like the conventional Golden Age nuclear-war narrative, but Ellison takes his critique in surprising new directions, insisting that the instigators of war are not impersonal bureaucrats, but hypocritical fathers whose adherence to Cold War sociopolitical ideals decimates the land and drives their children to rape, murder, and cannibalism.

Feminist SF authors of the 1960s and 1970s tended to be more optimistic about the future than their New Wave counterparts. This is apparent in Ursula K. Le Guin's 1969 novel The Left Hand of Darkness, which uses anthropology, sociology, and psychology to demonstrate how androgynous cultures might distribute childbearing responsibilities and thus power relations more equitably than cultures grounded in sexual division. It is even more evident in Marge Piercy's 1976 Woman on the Edge of Time and Joanna Russ's 1975 The Female Man, which illustrate how reproductive technosciences might reform social relations among men and women. In Piercy's mixed-sex utopia, babies are gestated in mechanical wombs while both men and women use hormone therapy to produce breast milk and enjoy the experience of mothering. Meanwhile, technologically enabled reproduction in Russ's single-sex utopia liberates women to engage in everything from romance to dueling. Like Bellamy and Gilman before them, feminist SF authors celebrated the possibility of creative social engineering. Drawing inspiration from their politically charged counterparts in the technoscientific professions, however, they insisted that such engineering would be not just a natural side effect of industrial production, but the deliberate achievement of men and women striving to change science and society alike.

New Wave and feminist ideas are still central to SF, but in recent decades the genre has evolved in response to two new technocultural events: the massive expansion of information technologies and the emergence of a transnational economic system supported by these technologies. In the early 1980s home video games and personal computers encouraged users to combine work and leisure in new ways within the privacy of their own homes; the development of the World Wide Web a decade later enabled users to reach out from those homes and forge new kinds of community based on affinity rather than biology or geography. Modern people have been further encouraged to rethink their relations to the larger world by virtue of their position within increasingly global networks of industrial production. The advent of such networks requires people - especially Western people - to reconsider who and what counts within the practice of science and technology. On the one hand, the dominance of industrial production suggests that Western ways of knowing the world are highly successful ones. But gaining access to a global stage allows people to share other technoscientific traditions with one another and even experiment with using those traditions (alone or in tandem with their Western counterparts) as templates for building new and truly more equitable global futures as well.

The premiere narrative form of the information age has no doubt been cyberpunk, the stylish mode of SF storytelling that merges strong interest in cybernetics and biotechnology with generally left-wing or libertarian politics and the do-it-yourself attitude of the early punk rock scene. The term “cyberpunk” was coined by SF author Bruce Bethke in his 1983 story of the same name, but was immediately taken up by editor Gardner Dozois to describe much of the fiction he was publishing in Isaac Asimov's SF Magazine at that time. First-generation cyberpunk fiction, including William Gibson's celebrated 1984 novel Neuromancer and the short stories collected in Bruce Sterling's 1986 Mirrorshades anthology, drew energy from the technocultural events of its time, providing SF with new character types and settings. In cyberpunk, creative engineers and faithful robots give way to amoral but usually good-hearted hackers and willful but usually benign artificial intelligences, all of whom struggle to survive and even transcend the conditions of their existence as tools of a transnational economy. Much of this drama takes place in cyberspace, a sphere of artificial or virtual reality where human and machine intelligences can interact with one another and with the flows of information that comprise modern capitalist practice itself. In the 1990s a new generation of SF novels - including Pat Cadigan's 1991 Synners, Neal Stephenson's 1992 Snow Crash, and Melissa Scott's 1996 Trouble and Her Friends - built upon the cyberpunk tradition by exploring how people (and machines) who recognize the value of raced and gendered bodies within the abstract world of computation might exchange the old dream of transcendence for the new one of material engagement, thereby transforming bad corporate futures into new and more egalitarian ones.

The technoscientific and social ideals endemic to cyberpunk have inspired the development of other SF sub-genres. The artificial intelligences of cyberpunk are predicated on what computer scientist and SF author Vernor Vinge has described as the technological singularity: a near-future moment when computational power enables the creation of superhumanly intelligent machines that change the world in ways that pre-singularity humans cannot even begin to imagine. This has not stopped Vinge trying to imagine such worlds in the 1981 novella True Names and the 1984 and 1986 novels The Peace War and Marooned in Real Time, all of which are told from the perspective of pre-singularity humans who survive the transition to a post-singularity society. Other notable books to explore this theme include Cory Doctorow's 1996 Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom and Charles Stross's 2005 Accelerando. Still other SF authors have seized upon the tension between cybernetic and biological enhancement, driving cyberpunk to imagine startling new “wet” futures. Key works in this vein include Kathleen Ann Goonan's 1994-2000 Nanotech Quartet, Paul Di Filippo's 1996 Ribofunk, and Margaret Atwood's 2003 Oryx and Crake. Although these works are very different in tone (Goonan's books are cautiously utopic, Atwood's novel is largely dystopic, and Di Filippo makes a playful end run around the whole issue), all three authors are, like their post-singularity counterparts, profoundly interested in the fate of human values, emotions, and aesthetic productions in a posthuman world.

The development of global socioeconomic networks has drawn attention to the fact that SF is no longer the exclusive province of white, Western people. Indeed, it turns out that this has never been the case. Over the course of the twentieth century that other great industrial nation, the Soviet Union, developed an SF tradition parallel to its anglophone counterpart. As early as 1970 English-speaking readers could learn about that tradition in Isaac Asimov's Soviet Science Fiction anthology; today, new anthologies such as Alexander Levitsky's 2008 Worlds Apart: An Anthology of Russian Science Fiction and Fantasy attest to the continued evolution of Russian SF. The SF community has also recently become aware of an alternate speculative fiction within the transatlantic region itself: Afrofuturism. Early Afrofuturist works include Edward Johnson's 1904 utopia Light Ahead for the Negro, W.E.B. Du Bois's 1920 disaster story “The Comet,” and George Schuyler's 1936-38 serialized future war stories Black Internationale and Black Empire. Since the 1960s Afrodiasporic authors including Samuel R. Delany, Octavia E. Butler, Nalo Hopkinson, and Minister Faust have become luminaries within the SF community; stories by these and other notable Afrofuturists are collected in Sherree R. Tepper's 2000 and 2004 Dark Matter anthologies and Hopkinson and Uppinder Mehan's 2004 So Long Been Dreaming: postcolonial science fiction and fantasy collection.

SF has flourished in countries as diverse as China, Japan, and Brazil since the late nineteenth century as well. Perhaps not surprisingly, authors from these countries began writing speculative fiction at the same time that merchants began using industrial technologies. The earliest of these publications include Huang Jiang Diao Sou's 1904 “Lunar Colony,” Oshikawa Shunro's 1900 Undersea Warship, and Joachim Felício dos Santos' 1868-72 Pages from the History of Brazil Written in the Year 2000. Anglo-American readers can learn about contemporary Chinese, Japanese, and Latin American SF in Dingbo Wu and Patrick D. Murphy's 1989 Science Fiction from China, Gene van Troyer and Grania Davis's 2007 Speculative Japan: outstanding tales of Japanese science fiction and fantasy, and Andrea L. Bell and Yolanda Molina-Gavilan's 2003 Cosmos Latinos: an anthology of science fiction from latin America and Spain. Like their Russian and Afrodiasporic counterparts, Chinese, Japanese, and Brazilian SF authors have both revised Western genre conventions and developed new ones in light of their own fantastic literary traditions to better dramatize the processes of industrialization and globalization in their own societies. Taken together, these speculative writing traditions demonstrate that SF is the literature not just of engineers, but of all people living in the modern world.",,2137965339,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Yaszek, Lisa", © 2011 Bruce Clarke with Manuela Rossini for introductions and editorial matter; individual contributions; the contributors, Reference Document,, English, English, Abingdon,2011,The Routledge Companion to Literature and Science,,2011,http://silk.library.umass.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/encyclopedias-reference-works/33-science-fiction-part-ii-disciplinary/docview/2137965339/se-2?accountid=14572," 33.

34. Design for Screen SF (Part III Issues and Challenges),"Sf film and television calls for an exceptionally high level of creative invention from those who realize the world of the “original” script for an audience - above all, perhaps, the designers of sets, costumes, and special effects. Annette Kuhn rightly emphasizes the centrality of the visual in sf film: “if science-fiction cinema possesses any distinctive generic traits, these . . . have to do in large measure with cinematographic technologies and with the ways in which these figure in the construction of diegetic and spectatorial spaces: while science-fiction films may certainly tell stories, narrative content and structure per se are rarely their most significant features” (Kuhn 1999: 11). Whether required to realize isolated artifacts and beings, as in The X-Files (1993-2002), or to evoke whole societies and topographies, as in Star Trek (1966-9), designers play a pivotal role in furnishing the “most significant features” of screen sf. Yet how may reflection on the role of design in sf film and television add to our understanding of these kinds of text?

To make any substantial claim about the significance of design for screen sf, we must first agree that there is, in visual and aural terms, something distinctive about the genre - something setting it apart from all others which use cinematic or televisual technologies to construct diegetic space. If there is a central and constant design imperative in screen sf, it can be best described as the principle of extended common sense. An sf diegesis must appear coextensive with “our” scientifically measurable and manageable world. Alien entities, however foreign or grotesque in bodily form, must seem as though they could operate within popularly understood laws of biology and physics; machines, however vast or advanced, must seem as though they could be engineered and successfully operated; and so on.

It is worth laboring the fact that the apparent, not theoretical, possibility of existence is the real concern of the sf designer. This is why I speak of extended common sense, rather than using the more scientifically skewed terms logic or reason. As numerous invectives against bad movie physics remind us, many of the sights and sounds of, say, starship battles in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (Lucas 1977) are quite contrary to physical laws, but they pass because they are common-sensical. In reality, the sounds of engines, missile fire, and detonations would not carry in the vacuum of space, and the incandescence of an explosion in the hull of a space-craft would be limited by the paucity of available oxygen. Yet the bangs and booms, provided that they seem appropriate in scale and tone, will resonate believably for most members of an audience who are familiar with the nearest real-life technological cognates: jet air travel and aerial warfare.

Thus, in a strange and tendentious way, design for sf is strongly oriented toward verisimilitude (Barsacq 1976:141). Nor should this be confused with mere illusionism, which is increasingly demanded of all fantastical screen fiction. For audiences to suspend their disbelief of flying scenes in the Harry Potter films (2001-), it is certainly true that the fantasy must be couched in terms of certain physical realities; for example, we expect Harry's hair to be ruffled or blown back in proportion to the velocity of his flight. Yet the conventions of magical fantasy do not call for the broom-stick to be made into a credible flying machine. By contrast, when the Green Goblin takes flight on his Goblin Glider in Spider-Man (Raimi 2002), the designer's invention must seem airworthy, with a visible power source, balancing mechanisms, and so on - even if the design is actually, from an aeronautical perspective, no less fanciful than the broomstick. In short, then, screen sf privileges a very particular kind of “to-be-looked-at-ness”: it is built primarily around visual phenomena which, while striking and novel, must appear to have a place in a contemporary common-sense worldview, informed by popular understanding of science.

But how can we proceed from these initial observations? The overarching claim for the importance of verisimilitude is of limited value in itself. An important corollary is that screen sf has always made an acute appeal to the viewer's sense of the tactile properties of unfamiliar phenomena. Consequently, among the classically defined elements of design, texture has always been paramount in sf, although the kind of surface detail generally favored by film- and program-makers has, over time, veered across the scale. This shifting taste is most obvious in the futuristic buildings, vehicles, weapons, and other machines which are arguably at the heart of the genre. Two distinct phases are identifiable. From the 1920s to the late 1960s, most designers leaned heavily upon modernist architectural and industrial design, above all in the idioms which emanated from the Bauhaus and the work of Le Corbusier. Sleek, streamlined forms, generally simple in profile and smooth in contour, and either shiny metallic or near-white were the norm: examples include Everytown in Things to Come (Menzies 1936), the lunar rocket in Destination Moon (Pichel 1950), and the Martian travel machines in War of the Worlds (Haskin 1953). Costume for everything except flesh-and-blood monsters tended to follow suit, with the apogee of this austere trend embodied in those of the alien Klaatu and his robot companion Gort in The Day the Earth Stood Still (Wise 1951). Such design was often juxtaposed with hyper-textured organic creatures, such as the eponymous protagonist of The Creature from the Black Lagoon (Arnold 1954).

After 1970, designers of screen sf rapidly and radically rejected streamlined modernism, and increasingly since then complex texturing has been prevalent. Part of the reason for this shift was undoubtedly the actual currency of spaceflight, which prior to the 1960s had been a central site of projective imagination in sf cinema. Both astronauts' garb and the craft in which they traveled were familiar sights in the mass media by the mid-1960s, but neither was a monument to sleek, seamless economy of line and contour. At the same time, confidence in the ideals of modernization and modernism was showing definite signs of disintegration, which began to express itself in contemporary architecture, industrial design, and fashion. Brutalist architects experimented with rough-hewn rather than smooth surfaces, while some mainstream early 1970s clothing, furnishing, and textile design had absorbed the “shaggy,” ethnic-oriented tastes of the countercultural hippies.

Three massively influential films of the later 1970s and early 1980s, all now associated with the mainstream popularization of screen sf (and more specifically the sf blockbuster), represent the apogee of the new commitment to textural complexity and variety. These films - Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Alien (Scott 1979), Blade Runner (Scott 1982) - also epitomize a visual retreat from, or potent visual critique of, modernism. The opening shots of Star Wars and Blade Runner clearly signal to the audience that the films' fictive worlds, however remote in time or space, are as complex and nuanced as the world outside the theater. Both offer vistas of technology which combine gargantuan scale and power with a clear sense of the intricacy and untidiness of real-world spaces and artifacts. The riveted metal plating and tightly packed surface excrescences of battleship decks are vividly recalled in the treatment of the two spacecraft at the beginning of Star Wars, and the smog, floodlights, besmirched chimneys and gantries of contemporary heavy industry are amplified a thousand-fold in the aerial shot of the hellish 2019 Los Angeles in Blade Runner. Nor does the bombardment of evocative visual data let up in either movie. Star Wars was groundbreaking not only for the range of environments but also for the sheer density of “lived-in” realism which inflects each one. The surfaces of buildings, vehicles, machinery, and robots are scratched, oil-smeared and scorched; clothing and battle armor (even for the all-powerful Darth Vader) look used and scuffed rather than pristine; and the action periodically moves through spectacularly grim, disorderly environments, including a traveling scrapyard and a garbage sump. Star Wars's aesthetic evokes the mixture of flyblown shabbiness and dustily expansive natural grandeur which John Ford, Sergio Leone, and Henry Hathaway had rendered so picturesque in their Technicolor westerns.

The claustrophobic Alien extended the visceral meta-realism of Star Wars. Most of the film takes place on the massive, interstellar freighter Nostromo. Seen from without, the ship is a threatening, lumpen mass, emphatically unlike the austerely elegant craft of movies such as Forbidden Planet (Wilcox 1956) and television series such as Star Trek. Within, the Nostromo is a medley of eerily familiar-seeming environments, combining forms and palettes associated with industrial and clinical spaces. The darkness and drear of the ship's unimposing metal walkways and dingy, topically lit command center are punctuated by “white” spaces of the infirmary, lab, computer center, and cryogenic sleeping quarters. Yet the high-value notes offer nothing upbeat or reassuring, for these bright interiors are no less visually cluttered in their profiles and contours, and their harsh lighting belies comfort or optimism. Nor is there anything eye-catching, far less stylish, about the crew's costumes: studiedly unremarkable, neutral fatigues which might as well date from the Second World War as from the future. In other words, design for the Nostromo is deceptively spectacular, for in Scott's onscreen presentation it is made to affect dreariness.

The highly textured, visually complex design imagery typical of late 1970s sf accommodated wildly different filmic sensibilities, from the eclectic romanticism of Star Wars to the near cinéma vérité character of Alien. Both complex texturing (or in Ridley Scott's term, “layering”) of design elements and the lived-in look continue to be used by designers in sf film and television as diverse as Delicatessen (Jeunet and Caro 1991), Demolition Man (Brambilla 1993), Battlestar Galactica (2004-), and Torchwood (2006-). Clearly these design sensibilities carry no special ethical or ideological valence. They are merely among those conventions which tend to accrue to any genre over time, and can be justified only in terms of filmmakers' and audiences' (perceived) expectations of what instances of that genre should look like.

The discovery of consistent stylistic concerns in screen sf does not really contribute much to our understanding of the genre's nuances. To pursue the ways in which design might generate meaning, it is necessary to move from the generic to the particular - to examine individual texts. Let me at once enter a caveat: it is not my intention in what follows to identify some kind of opposition between narrative and design. The idea that design imagery can potentially obscure, thwart, or block narrative, as more than one commentator has claimed, is based on a false premise (Affron and Affron 1995: 36-7; Tashiro 1998: 15-16, 21). Design is spatial: narrative is teleological; narrative is in part borne by, and in principle wholly reducible to, words; design is not (Britton and Barker 2003: 16-17). So rather than ask how design relates to narrative, as though the two had the potential to harmonize or quarrel, it is more productive to ask how design can operate within the whole imaginative and conceptual experience invoked by screen entertainment. In relation to sf, this overarching question begs more particularized ones. First, since design must tap into the viewer's common-sense response in order to uphold sf's meta-reality effect, by what means does it do so? And second, how much does design imagery excite reflection or speculation about the diegetic reality and the text's underlying ideas?

In addressing these questions, I will focus on Blade Runner and Firefly (2002-3) because the different role of design in each is heightened by the fact that they have certain baseline commonalities. Both exhibit that generic hybridity or “borrowing” which, at least since the 1970s, has been a standard modality of sf. Blade Runner draws heavily on the private-eye movie and film noir, involving as it does an attempt by a police detective to track down a group of killer androids. Firefly is a frontier saga in the manner of a western, following a gang of good-hearted thieves: it recalls not only historical facts of nineteenth-century America (such as a recent civil war) but also the manners, idiomatic speech, and other affectations of characters in screen westerns. In both texts, design is crucial to establishing the generic allegiance - and, of course, also necessarily a prime descriptor of the ways in which the worlds we see are not of the past but of the future.

One cannot discuss design in Blade Runner without acknowledging that this is a film with competing versions. The 1982 theatrical releases, with voiceover and happy ending, was largely supplanted by the 1991 “director's cut,” from which both narration and the final sequence were omitted, but into which some excised footage - of an enigmatic reverie sequence - was reintegrated, with a 2007 “final cut” offering another version of the dream and, among other things, tidying up some continuity errors. Although the production design is powerfully evocative in all versions, it almost inevitably possesses more unconstrained potential for meaning in the later versions. The original version's voiceover tends to direct viewers' attention and inflect their responses, curbing some of the speculation and imaginative engagement for which the many protracted silences of the director's and final cuts open up a space. Consequently, I will focus on the latter versions. Without the Chandleresque monologue, the scene which introduces the protagonist, ex-“blade runner” Deckard, runs for over a minute with no substantive dialogue. The following sequence, in which Deckard's erstwhile colleague Gaff takes him to police headquarters in his flying “spinner,” runs for almost as long with no diegetic sound except machine noise and the muted chatter of police radio communication. One could cite even longer dialogue-free scenes. With this kind of protracted exposure to nothing but bodies and objects in space, the suggestive power of design will almost inevitably loom large for the audience.

At a purely descriptive level, Blade Runner's set design consistently affirms Scott's chosen aesthetic of a film set 40 years in the future but in the style of 40 years ago (Webb 1996: 44), for this is not only a noir city but also an almost oppressively art deco city. The “Mayan Revival” aesthetic of cast-concrete blocks used for the walls of Deckard's apartment is only the most oft-seen of an almost unceasing array of grooved, striated, and raised surfaces, most of which evoke the rich architectural ornament of the interwar period. Even the unequivocally futuristic exterior of the Police Headquarters building follows suit: the ridged roof of this essentially cylindrical building is subdivided into seven flared landing platforms which recall the stepped trapezoid motif so endemic to deco.

Costume is consonant with sets not only in that much of the dress evokes 1940s fashions - the square-shouldered suits and high-collared fur coats worn by the main female character, Rachael; Deckard's and Gaff's trench coats; the dinner jacket and octagonal glasses worn by android-manufacturer Tyrell - but also in the fact that most of the items have exceptionally rich surfaces. Deckard's broad trench-coat collar is wide-wale corduroy, his sports jacket of nubby tweed; one of Rachael's dresses is made up of broad horizontal strips of different silks, one of her coats consists of strips of faux-fur; and so on. Most remarkable of all is the correspondence between Tyrell's white matelassé dressing gown and the raised-lozenge panels of his bedroom doors, a detail which camera setups and editing provide ample opportunity to register.

This texturing of costume - together with the widespread use of muted, low-value palettes and multiple patterns - actually serves to defamiliarize the “vintage” forms, sidestepping the kind of nostalgia courted by the 1940s-esque visual world of Batman (Burton 1989). This defamiliarization is furthered by appositional contrast, such as the punk-influenced costumes and coiffures of the androids, especially their leader, Batty, and the high-tech modes of transport seen throughout (although the various road vehicles' shells actually have a sub-Cubist aesthetic not wholly inconsistent with the art deco norm). Conversely, the mass of accreted mechanical detail and quotidian flotsam in almost every scene - pipe-work, ducting, exhaust fans, fizzing fluorescent lights, uncollected trash piles, brazier fires, and so on - seems all too familiar, quite plausibly extending the grubby, retro-fitted mishmash of present-day high-density cities. Although Blade Runner speaks of interstellar travel beyond our current capabilities, its visual paraphernalia is compellingly credible as a common-sense image of the near future.

Beyond both evoking and complicating the noir benchmark, the film's saturation-level visual incident also plays powerfully into its larger conceptual concerns. As already implied, this is a movie so measured in pace as to be almost a montage of tableaux vivants and still-lifes: even the few action sequences are stately, balletic, and stylized. Attention to physical detail is oppressive, down to the lovingly photographed, minute swirl of blood in Deckard's shot glass as, after a fight, he drinks with lacerated lips. The film boasts a ceaseless pageant of fetishized phenomena, from the conventionally prized (Rachael's ultra-glossy hair, Gaff's and Batty's cool leather coats, the gorgeously rich “concrete textile” walls of Deckard's apartment) to the surreal, the sinister, and the sick (eyeballs floating in a tank of nutrients, Batty's pallid hand involuntarily clenched in the onset of his death throes). The consistent, mesmeric appeal to the sense of touch and the sensual foregrounding of manufactured artifacts in effect establish parity between inanimate objects and human bodies. How telling, in a text which is overtly concerned with distinguishing humans from their physically identical android counterparts, and with questions of how truth and identity are made.

Blade Runner begins with a tacit injunction to look: in the second shot, an eyeball fills the frame, reflecting the Los Angeles cityscape. Yet the unreliability of perception - in the metaphorical as well as literal sense - is stressed throughout, and special effects design plays a key, albeit subtle, part in this. Photographs are supposed to fix memories, to provide certitude. Yet when Rachael brings childhood snapshots to Deckard to prove to him that she is not an android, one of them briefly flickers into life in his hands as though making the fixed reality of the past fugitive. The effect is so deftly realized as to be almost subliminal. In summary, then, inasmuch as the relationships between memory, emotional experience, identity, and knowledge are central to the script of Blade Runner, the conception and deployment of design imagery establishes them as central to the construction of Blade Runner as a whole text - visual and aural.

Because of its smaller screen size and corresponding loss of definition, television cannot offer so sensuously absorbing an experience, nor so clearly defined a spectacle, as theatrically released films, even in the age of “home cinema.” As a medium, television is therefore relatively ill-equipped to indulge the kind of intensely evocative pictorialism of directors such as Ridley Scott. If this is a general limitation, the television series as a form creates other, very specific problems for the designer - and these are greatly intensified for sf, given the constraints on budget and time. While a series is intended to command audience loyalty, it must remain “porous” enough to attract casual viewers. The onus of maintaining unity and continuity while effecting regular reintroductions and extensions of the diegetic world is considerable, especially for the designers who are responsible for settings (real or virtual).

In addition to these medium- and form-based difficulties, some of the design challenges in Firefly stemmed from the fact that its creator, Joss Whedon, so heavily exploited sf's capacity to hybridize. Firefly calls for the audience to believe in a very particular fusion of cultures and generic signifiers, even though the main components of this amalgam make slightly uneasy bedfellows. On the one hand, Firefly's projection of a would-be utopian Sino-American interplanetary alliance does not strain audience credulity: Pacific Rim sensibilities are now well entrenched in screen sf, so Firefly's images of cities and other spaces which amplify characteristics of Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Taipei could rest on generic precedent. On the other, the centrality of American Civil War and pioneer-era overtones had the potential seriously to upset the text's credibility if too strongly mirrored in design. Images of the “Old West,” as that phrase implies, are expressive of an emphatically discrete, remote past, and consequently more difficult to project into a fictional future than, say, the machine-turned, crystalline motifs of art deco. This holds good even if we accept that Firefly is at some level a tongue-in-cheek twist on earlier science-fiction frontier narratives, such as the original Star Trek. Coarsely western-influenced design could easily have pushed such knife-edge playfulness into the realm of parody. The principle of extended common sense is upheld in Firefly by a variety of means, all of which tend to strengthen the series' distinctiveness and mute any potential “hokiness.” In design terms, what yokes Firefly's various generic constituents together is the fact that they are tempered and melded by reference to aspects of the contemporary world which we take for granted. As noted above, for nearly a generation now this appeal to the “normal” has been a common conceit in screen sf design, but Firefly's designers went to unprecedented lengths in making an array of aspects of design self-effacing. A prime example is the use of conventional projectile weapons rather than laser guns. This not only makes sense in (and of) the quasi-western context but also renders the weaponry unremarkable.

The sophistication of the set and principal model design is that it hides its conceptual elegance in the seemingly familiar. Carey Meyer's exquisitely conceived and realized interiors for Serenity, the Firefly-class spaceship of the show's title, relate the ship to the unselfconscious forms of contemporary air and sea freighters: the studiedly workaday interior gives a strong impression of being ergonomically sound and for the most part baldly utilitarian. Lovely touches in the set dressing confirm that this is a domicile in which day-to-day problems have been solved in earthily reasonable ways. In the communal living space, for instance, shelves have netting guards strung in front of them to contain objects that might be displaced in a bumpy flight.

Utilitarian touches are overlaid with selective, unostentatious humanizing detail, such as the vine of foliate stenciling over the communal space's resolutely cheery, primary-color paint scheme, which sounds a touching note of domestic cosiness. Even on a 40-inch television screen, such detail is not rendered picturesque for the viewer; far less is it demanding of the gaze à la Blade Runner. It is in aggregate that shots of Meyer's sets offer a persuasive description of homely routine in rooms apparently designed to be livable rather than photogenic. Nothing, including most of the instrumentation, seems startlingly futuristic; but nor is it self-consciously retro. Thus, when we see the ship's captain, Mal Reynolds, eating with chopsticks while drinking from a pioneer-style tin mug, the potential anachronism of the latter has already been defused by the ethos of Meyer's set. We might well expect such cheaply available and crude wares to form part of the unpretentious hotchpotch of daily life so consistently avowed by this set.

Perhaps the most sensitive area of design in terms of both expressing and managing Firefly's western aesthetic is costume. As a generality, the clothed body occupies rather more than half the screen on television, so any effect is likely to loom large - and potentially distract. Yet costume must also speak clearly to genre and character, especially in a text such as this, which for all its action set pieces is strongly character driven. Not merely the broad frontier/reconstruction narrative of Firefly but also the idiom of dialog itself seems to demand some kind of nod to “Old West” dress. Several of the protagonists speak in a Southern-inflected patois, and quasi-“western” collo-quialisms pervade the dialogue: the crew call Serenity a “boat,” not a ship, say “'verse” for universe, use “conjure” where we would say “guess” or “suspect,” and so on. Mal's clothing does indeed seem as though it might hail from the Civil War era, with suede duster, suspenders and knee-length boots, but in this respect he is alone. His costume is offset by the dress of the two other most overtly “Southern” characters, engineer Kaylee and tough-guy Jayne. Both are clothed in a manner which is, to all intents and purposes, present-day: Jayne wears athletic-fit T-shirts and combats, while Kaylee typically sports funkily colored, contemporary stretch shirts under her coveralls. Having said that, designers Jill Ohanneson and Shawna Trpcic sidestepped the danger of Mal's dress appearing at odds with his crew's through their handling of palette. Since warm, “earth” tones closely correspondent with Mal's dominate costumes for nearly the whole group, his outfit appears distinctive, even iconic, but not outré.

The other design strategy which encourages acceptance of Mal's dress, and simultaneously cements the overall hybrid aesthetic of the Firefly 'verse, is the fact that his is not the only “heritage” costume. One of his companions, the courtesan Inara, dresses in garments variously redolent of the Chinese qipao and the Indian lehnga choli. Inara's are the series' most eye-catching outfits, by virtue both of their inherent sumptuousness and the fact that she has a new one for each episode. That she provides a visual counterweight to Mal's stately quasi-Victorian dress is especially apt, since the two characters question each other's values throughout, and there is unresolved sexual tension between them.

Just because Firefly is so strongly character driven, higher-order questions about the role of design yield answers as subtle, even reticent, as the designs themselves. While Firefly does not address philosophical matters relating to the nature of identity, it is oriented toward another frequent concern of sf. Many episodes deal with consequences of the invasive use of technology, in terms of both the manipulation of the individual and the problems of large-scale social engineering. To put this more broadly, the series addresses mutual responsibility at both the global and local levels. Consequently, quite apart from any other consideration of genre, medium or budget, Firefly's primary focus on society and the “chosen family” of Mal's crew precludes a design aesthetic like Blade Runner's, in which people and artifacts enjoy visual parity. Spectacle is an inevitable constituent of screen sf, but in Firefly it was necessary to restrain it - to avoid a situation in which design compromised the plausibility of the text's fictional world, with costumes “drowning” the characters who wore them. Although it is touched upon in both case studies, I have given relatively little attention to the ways in which design imagery is mediated to the audience in the production process. This is not to undervalue the role of cameraman and lighting director, whose work crucially modifies the “raw materials” of costume and set design. But ultimately, for present purposes, I justify privileging materiality in this chapter by the fact that sf itself privileges materiality. Realized designs fundamentally dictate the conditions of their presentation: the smooth and sweeping moderne forms of the Aerospace Corporation headquarters in Gattaca (Niccol 1997) could never light like the baroque textures of the spaceship Auriga interiors in Alien: Resurrection (Jeunet 1997).

So, in conclusion, let me return to the notion of restraint. I hesitate to endorse, even by default, an image of design as some Kong-like beast, always seeking to break its bonds and run amok. Yet just because of its intrinsic generic tendencies, film- and program-makers working in sf undeniably need to calculate how much of the evocative potential of design they really want to “unleash” in any given text.",,2137944435,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Britton, Piers D."," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

44. Freedom of Expression and Cultural Production in the Age of Vanishing Privacy (Part IV: Impacts),"The advent of the internet gave rise to a series of interrelated myths that determine how we will think about censorship and human rights for the foreseeable future. Clichés such as “information wants to be free,” “with instant global access, censorship no longer exists,” and “the market decides what gets sold and read” operate on the assumption that we are in a golden age for freedom of expression and information circulation, distribution, and access. But these apparently new freedoms conflict with traditional rights in particular ways. Simply put, freedom of expression for an individual often conflicts with the freedom to disseminate information of corporate information gatherers. I don't want all of my GPS data available, you don't want your notes accessible to all, that celebrity (or that once-silly college student and now-serious job candidate) is horrified to find her private photos are posted on sites all over the net. In today's net culture, one often-neglected aspect of the freedom of expression has risen in importance - the freedom not to express, the freedom to be silent. And this freedom to be silent is but another name for privacy. Individuals now desperately want to be their own censors, in control of the circulation of their personal data. And yet, time and again, religious organizations, nation-states, and multimedia corporations have continued to assert their privileged positions as monopolistic controllers of their particular media networks, whether through claims that they own the cultural products posted by users on their sites or through the denial of service to particular users. The T-mobile blackout of “sms txtmob” services, which had allowed vast numbers of activists to coordinate around the Republican National Convention in New York City in 2004; the “great firewall” in China; and the shutting down of Twitter in Syria: all of these have become signs that censorship continues today as a major problem of social interaction and political organization (Hirsch and Henry 2005; Stevenson 2007; Reed 2000; Clayton et al. 2006; Baker 2014; Jansen 2010; Chaabane et al. 2014).

Such technological restrictions on access to cellular and internet networks might seem like inconveniences of modern life rather than “censorship,” invasions of privacy, or even violations of human rights. But historically, censorship has created classes with access to information and classes without; whether the Roman Catholic Church's control over their infamous Index or Google's control over its global search engine, those with authority over the dissemination of information have used it as a means of social control. And it is at the moment when individuals think that they are no longer under the control of an external and nameable authority that censorship may have finally succeeded in the goal of erasing its own trace. The most efficient and rational censorship is a censorship of which we are not aware, a way of thinking that feels as if it bears no relation even to self-censorship. So it is precisely when we find ourselves hesitant to label new phenomena in the mediascape (such as corporate decisions to curtail dissemination) as censorship that we need to rethink our current place in the history and structure of censorship. But how can we identify what is and what is not censorship when we barely sense anything out of the ordinary, when we genuinely feel free to express most of our opinions most of the time? The problem of the circulation of cultural products and the human right to expression has become so complex in recent years - from scholarly, political, and public viewpoints - that it has become impossible to understand it within simple binary terms of freedom versus censorship or privacy versus public good. This chapter is an attempt to form a theoretical basis, informed by historical understanding, for linking rights discourse with recent developments in censorship studies in light of changes in social media over the last half-century.

Article 19.
Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
(Universal Declaration of Human Rights [UDHR] 1948)
On the point of stating not an inherent fact of nature, but rather a positive ideal - that we should possess the liberty to hold views and make them public - the Universal Declaration of Human Rights' Article 19 gestures to dire realities, namely that such “interference” has occurred and continues to occur (1948). Article 19 goes on to suggest several defining characteristics of historical literary bans: they have sought not only to quash material traces of dissident belief that might circulate far and wide (“impart information and ideas”), but also those that are simply manifest as opinions held in the minds of individuals (“hold opinions without interference”); they have typically arisen at moments of media transfer and border-crossing (“through any media and regardless of frontiers”); they have often meddled not only at the level of production, but also at the level of consumption (“to seek, receive, and impart”). Thus, it is clear even at the outset that the rhetoric of rights grapples directly with a long history of suppression and repression, which characterizes the actual lived experience of most humans. Such declarations of freedom of expression constitute statements of aspiration to a negative right - the freedom from actual censorships.

The study of literary censorship addresses concerns about how the contents of literary material can impact individual readers and society as a whole and about how some of our most fundamental human attributes (our thought and expression) are policed. And like the study of human rights, it is often based on the claim that a nonexistent, yet ideal state of freedom from censorship is natural and inalienable, or, at minimum, desirable. The rhetoric of human rights for its part might be productively compared with the literary genre of near future fiction, an aspirational discourse that prescribes a utopia or describes a dystopia as an extrapolation of our situation today rather than describing real existing circumstances. Indeed, this genre has had a deep role in helping us to see the efficacy and potential pitfalls of the rhetoric of rights. Near-future dystopic fiction has perhaps best allegorized the lack of justice in the real world. If the rise of dystopian speculative fiction novels from George Orwell's epic 1984 (1949) to the most recent iteration in Dave Eggers' The Circle (2014) has paralleled the history of human rights dialogue, then we should not be surprised that such fiction has become a significant mode for teaching human rights, asserting both what is morally right about our lofty declarations and what is logically wrong with our present reality. Whether the involuntary surveillance by the state of 1984 or the willing submission to surveillance by netizens in The Circle, the vanishing of privacy parallels and is connected to a growth of nuance in censorship. From Orwell to Eggers, we find the lack of controls on information gathering and the endless controls on individual expression to be the greatest threats to concepts of individual rights, to private thought, and to public action.

Cultural production as a field of discursive endeavor has been a contentious ground for censorship. Among the least direct forms of dissent, but occasionally the most targeted, literature particularly draws more heated and debated scrutiny because it is (along with the jargon of specialist fields from the hard sciences to philosophy) a highly coded form of signification. And yet unlike elite specialist fields with their own means of obfuscation, literature is often pitched to a great variety of readers; because of this perceived threat of wider dissemination, historically, censors have focused closely on literature. At once susceptible to misunderstanding and also seemingly free from day-to-day political constraints of newspapers and other more putatively factual forms of writing, literature can achieve (even under repressive regimes), through flowery and metaphoric language, what other forms seem unable to do - expressing views that veer from social and communal norms.

There are two primary ways that the relationship between literature and freedom of expression has been conceived; despite the fact that both of these ways seem to reflect something of the truth of experience, they are mutually contradictory: first, literary creativity is said to require freedom of expression (censorship will stifle literary production); second, literature is often viewed as a way to circumvent censorship (censorship promotes literature.) The first more common understanding suggests that censorship is the antithesis of literature. Literature in this figuration is a mark of individual freedom, the absence or conquering of censorship.

To say we need freedom from censorship, however, then is also to say we need the right to straight talk about serious issues, and this could also be a plea for not having to speak in metaphoric or literary ways. Rather than being seen as antithetical to literature, the other view finds censorship constitutive of the literary. Belles lettres have long been viewed as having developed as methods for circumvention of authority (Hegel 1975: 387). A version of this argument goes that censorship is not counter to literature; censorship creates literature as we know it. And counterintuitively, this point has even been taken further to link golden ages of cultural production with the most repressive and suppressive regimes (Losev 1984; Strauss 1952; Hoffman 2007; Peters 1989). In this sense, the very existence of literature as such is simply the cultural collateral damage of such censorship regimes. Such claims rest on the argument that literary language is circuitous and, therefore, thrives when authorities suppress straight talk about topics declared taboo, forbidden, or illegal. When the censorship system defined this way works, literature successfully conveys a forbidden idea in ways that are hidden from the censors but legible to readers.

This latter view assumes literature always already to be of radical or subversive underlying message, but literature has not always been a vanguard genre pushing the bounds of the expressible. In fact, as a form of bourgeois and middlebrow culture written and read most often by those with the time and money to do so, the majority of modern literature falls very much within the bounds of modern social, political, and religious mores. In fact, much literature (whether the Bildungsroman, stories with Confucian endings that reward virtue and punish vice, or quest narratives) has been structured around taming the id, educating the individual to fit better into society and culture and the nation, censoring out the unacceptable impulses. As a leisure time escape and release, modern literature has occasionally been the site for imagining alternative realities, pushing not only aesthetic bounds but also social decorum and political orthodoxy. To the extent that it seeks transformation, literature has been correctly targeted by those seeking to maintain the status quo. The degree to which we think that the impulse towards change is part of literature itself determines whether we think literature is opposed to censorship, produced by it, or simply in a relationship fluctuating between the two.

Following the linguistic turn in philosophy, there has been a shift in censorship studies from consideration of censorship as a solely external phenomenon having to do with governments, religious institutions, and even corporations as the authorities of censorship to a focus on how the internal mechanisms of repression are related to such external historical offices of suppression. In recent scholarship, freedom of the press has increasingly been viewed as a pie-in-the-sky ideal, with the real situation of writing and publishing residing on a continuum between self-censorship and censorship. When censorship is seen in this way, it is a constant condition of literary production rather than a temporary aberration (Burt 1994; Butler 1997; Post 1998; Holquist 1994). If modern understandings of language and psychology brought forth the idea that censorship is truly ineluctable, today the omnipresence of technological surveillance actively fills in the middle ground between censorship and self-censorship by shrinking the space of the private. When a handful of companies track our data-packets and movements, claim the copyrights to the fruits of our intellectual labor posted on their sites, and literally construct the ground platforms and formats upon which we write, can we claim our individual expression in cyberspace is ever free? Further, the identification of external/internal or censorship/self-censorship continuums mimics, if with some delay, the recognition already present in Article 19 of the UDHR that opinion is of equal importance to the expression of that opinion.

The conceptions of the right to free expression from the Enlightenment until today have more and more associated the material expression of opinion in recorded/recordable format (from print to YouTube) with the intangible “holding” of opinion. This conflation raises the question whether a subject/citizen can even hold opinions that are not expressed. Indeed, from the Inquisition to the Communist conversions of the early twentieth century, through the midcentury McCarthyist campaigns to rout out “un-American activities,” and the later “if you're not with us, you're against us” attitudes of the post 9/11 “War on Terror,” which led to the waterboarding of suspected terrorists in the twenty-first century, the verbal confession of taboo thoughts and plans has been a perpetual, integral part of mechanisms of suppression and repression. But it is precisely in a censorship regime's need for (even coerced) expression of opinion - the need to materialize (record and report) such intangible opinions - that the rights discourse conflating the tangible and intangible breaks down. Because if simply holding the opinion were truly the crime, one could prosecute it without expression. And though this occasionally happens, the institution of confession seems to be the more common modern practice. Since in practice its expression is necessary to prove the holding of dissident opinion, mere accusation is seldom enough to constitute proof of dissent.

These shifts in thinking about the structure determining the function of censorship parallel the gradual historical relocation of censoring authority (at least in a western context) from the church, to the nation-state, and more recently to the global conglomerates that control much of the world's media. Under religious and secular or village and state censors, it may have been easier to identify the external institutions of censorship. But matters have been made murky by corporate claims about market considerations, as in the aftermath of 9/11, when Clear Channel made a no-play list of 150 songs deemed too emotionally stirring, or when Amazon chose for a time not to carry the translation of Thierry Meyssan's conspiracy theory book 9/11: The Big Lie (“It's the End” 2001; Riding 2002). Today those with the means to control the flows of information claim to be acting with disinterest in content, focusing on profit, and following the market. But as the cases of 9/11 in the US and 3/11 in Japan show, providers provide content based not only on the desires of individual consumers, on aggregate consumer demand, and on market pressures, but also on the basis of discretion, decorum, and restraint (Belson and Onishi 2011).

The rise of the corporation as the primary institution of censorship has coincided with the growing ease of publication for individuals with both means and access. Often coded in the neoliberal rhetoric of “letting the market decide” (as though the decision between giving personal data and metadata to Microsoft or Apple, Google or Yahoo is, indeed, a free choice and not a precondition for entrance into the discursive field today), this situation has led to a series of dilemmas for individual rights. Can human rights rhetoric and law designed for a world run by nation-states intervene in a field in which the primary actors have become nongovernmental, nonhuman corporations - Amazon, Weibo, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Microsoft, Comcast, Time Warner, Alibaba, Rakuten, and so on? Who can be held accountable for the company policies to which we willingly submit when we click “OK” on end user agreements? As individuals participate in the new public discursive venues must they give up privacy elsewhere? Have metadata (mail addresses on the outsides of envelopes, ticket stubs showing arrivals and departures, receipts and purchase orders, library cards and stamps that record borrowing dates and sometimes borrower names) historically been private property of the individual? Is the control and regulation of information flow different from censorship? Should internet service providers be considered “common carriers” and, therefore, be restricted from peeking inside the data-packets we have them deliver to our screens (Ammori 2014; Frieden 2008; Speta 2001; Brodkin 2014)?

The vanishing privacy of the individual has accompanied the expansion of individual rights for corporations in terms not only of copyright (see the 2003 Copyright Term Extension Act [CTEA], which lengthened the term of copyright on Disney's Steamboat Willy beyond the life of Walt Disney and his heirs for the benefit of the corporation alone), but also in terms of free speech. In the twisted legalese of the more recent Citizen's United and Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decisions, in which corporations (redefined as persons in US legal precedent since the late nineteenth century) now have won the right to free speech, we find perhaps the ultimate challenge not only to the concept of the individual, but also to notions of rights and the human writ large (Brown 2013; Ghoshray 2011; Clermont 2010). When corporate actions are deemed to be protected under human rights (originally developed to protect individuals from corporate government overreach), individuals are left without recourse, desiring to censor or regulate the speech and information collection of this new class of corporate “humans.”

Paradoxically, the same personification that has enabled corporations to bend the right to free speech to their benefit might also be essential to the definition of freedom of expression as a human right in the first place. Freedom of expression represents one of the limits of human rights because it is a right that seems to accrue both to human beings and to the inanimate objects they produce. Not only human bodies, but the thoughts and public expressions produced by such bodies, too, need the protection offered by the right to speak freely. An important task for the ethics of rights is to relate freedom as consonant not only with the body of human beings, but also with the stuff of humans. Metaphors that consider both persons as things and things as persons have helped us to better elaborate property rights, cultural heritage claims to spoils seized in war, and freedom of expression. The origins of property rights are tied to the institutions of marriage and slavery (moments when persons have been thingified); cultural heritage claims have reversed the discourse claiming particular things to be (in effect) proper to a given people, community, or nation; and words, books, and styles have been personified in order to defend the freedom of expression by authors from Cervantes to Milton and Marx to Heine. If a book is organic and animate, to censor is to kill. This recognition of the link between personification and expression as a right may be most clear in Milton's Areopagitica in which he famously gave life to books: “he who destroys a good Book, kills reason itself, kills the Image of God, as it were in the eye” (Milton 1999: 42). In Milton's call for the freedom of expression and in countless such calls since, we find the stuff of humans personified in rhetoric with the specific political end of calling for the protection of that stuff. Personification then throws into stark relief the confusion inherent in the right to freedom of expression; do calls for the right to freedom of expression call for protection of the human expressers or for the free circulation (or life) of the expressions themselves? Further, such personification reminds us that, historically, violence against human bodies has gone hand-in-hand with atrocities against human creations. Or as Heinrich Heine wrote in his play Almansor about burnings of the Koran: “That's only the prelude. Where books are burnt, you also end up burning people” (Heine 1823: 148, translation mine).

The question of who or what counts as human in human rights is deeply rooted in the problem of the material and the intangible. This is not simply because censorship acts on both material in the world and intangible human ideas, but because the right to freedom of expression seeks to protect both cultural products and the potential internal effects of those products. Most human rights in the UDHR aim to protect the life of the mortal coil (the human body) from violation and violence, but freedom of expression seeks to protect something both at once less animate and more animate than the human being or human body. Whether painted in oil on a canvas, inked on a paper, saved in magnetic impulses on a tape, burned with lasers on a disk, or simply rendered through contrasting colors of pixels on a screen, the utterly inorganic cultural products circulating through society are things that are severed from the human the moment they transition from idea to prosthesis as something that exists outside of the human body.

One place where freedom of expression and cultural production have a direct relation is in the expression and representation of human rights violations which themselves are often targets of censorial authority. In recent years debates about both pornographic images and images of torture (“atrocity porn”) have been the ground for much thinking about rights and freedom of expression. The tension between the human body protected by some rights and the representations protected by others has been a challenge to the right to freedom of expression. This challenge is perhaps best epitomized in the development of debates about pornography over the last 30 years: second-wave feminists critiqued pornography as violence against women (Dworkin 1985); third-wave feminists largely dismantled such work, thinking more seriously about the multiple gendered agencies involved in porn production (Williams 1999); and these debates have been transformed yet again in the digital world (Cornell 2000; Attwood 2007; Kleinhans 2004). The spirit of protecting women from exploitation and abuse called for censorship of material that might encourage such criminal behavior. Yet the ways in which women had become a powerful part of the porn industry complicated any specific notion of exploitation or causal understanding of the correlation between porn and gendered violence. And the development of computer-generated imaging (CGI) brought the possibility of producing disturbingly explicit and violent pornography in which no real humans were directly exploited. Do entirely fabricated pornographic images that demean women constitute hate speech? We can begin to imagine the disclaimer: “no actual women were harmed in the creation of this porn.” And this question leads to a related corollary: do the already prevalent images depicting violence against animals in our culture (whether actually captured on film as the light reflecting off of the real animal bodies being cruelly treated or simply the CGI rendering thereof) create, support, or incite violence to actual animals in the real world?

For cases in which the pornography shot under coercion and duress captures and then represents real and direct violence to individuals, the case for human rights seems clear. In those cases, the pornographic material is nothing more than a documentation of acts violating other human rights. Another recent case illuminates the problems of virtuality, censorship, and human rights in a slightly different way. From the standpoint of human rights, the circulation of images of the abuses at Abu Ghraib is a social good. Despite the best efforts of the US government to prevent the circulation of the images, widespread knowledge of the abuses became available through the rapid Internet dissemination of the images. We may all agree that the release of those actual images of torture and humiliation at Abu Ghraib was useful in exposing the human rights violations there and, therefore, that the censorship of such images simply enables such violations (Middleton 2011; Hansen 2014; Laustsen and Ugilt 2012). We can easily imagine the counterfactual: what if those images had been successfully censored? Then all we might have would be the oddity that is the Legofesto website's photographs (Legofesto 2006a-2009, 2006b-2013) that recreate the Abu Ghraib images in the world of colorful plastic toys by posing the figures in precisely the same positions as the US soldiers posed their captives. Here we have a complete reversal of the logic of censorship and pornography: those who would censor porn along with those who would censor the Abu Ghraib images would do so because of the fact that the images document real violence to bodies; however, the computer-generated images of porn may cultivate precisely the same responses despite the fact that no body was directly hurt in the creation of those images, and the images of the Legofesto website would never be considered a threat because they are entirely virtual. In this case the virtual images are disregarded by the censoring authority because they are unreal (if still true), while the real photos mattered to the censoring authority as damning evidence of imperial power.

When we express the human right to free speech or expression or freedom from censorship, we tend to mean first and foremost neither the right to scream “fire” in a theater, something with a direct sociological cost (see Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47 [1919]), nor the right to create and distribute documentation of the human rights exploitation of individual people as in pornography. However, the circulation of certain kinds of documentation such as the “atrocity porn” of Abu Ghraib might be good for humans around the world until cases are demanded at the Hague. What must be meant when we say the right to freedom of expression, then, is different from what we are saying. What must be meant first and foremost is a limited right to say things that may sway opinions in a number of different directions (without direct incitements to violence or without speech that is seen as an act of violence in and of itself - such as hate speech). A problem and debate arises from the perception of direct harmful effect. Who gets to decide what constitutes violence or direct social and individual harm? In the case of pornography, the debate has moved from direct harm to those filmed to the cultural harm of attitudes towards women. With Abu Ghraib, the reason for censorship of the images was to protect the institutions of empire (the occupation forces), not those depicted.

Today, as individual rights are giving way to the assertion of corporate privilege, it seems the freedom of expression for individuals needs as much protection from those with power as ever. This is not simply to reject the capitalist claim for the necessity of a market free for corporations to practice economic exploitation of labor, but also to understand that when corporate entities (whether governments or multinational NGOs) secure discursive market control, they will have finally beat dissent. To use another of Milton's metaphors, there can only be the classic “free market of ideas” when the barriers for entrance to and sustainability in the discursive field are level for individuals. What the corporate demand for free speech amounts to is nothing less than a method of regulating the market for individual expression. Until such an always-to-come moment arrives, the right to free expression for the individual will need to be guarded.",,2137954901,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Abel, Jonathan E."," © 2016 Sophia A.

47. Arthouse SF Film (Part IV Subgenres),"In 1968, Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey encapsulated the two new directions facing sf cinema. On the one hand, its large budget and cutting-edge special effects, created by Douglas Trumbull, removed the sf film from the realm of the comparatively low-budget B-Movie of the 1950s and situated it clearly within big-budget Hollywood cinema. On the other hand, in its slow pace, poetic visual imagery, and narrative ambiguity, it had far more in common with arthouse cinema (or art film) than with previous Hollywood output. Arthouse cinema, originally associated with European cinema in the 1940s-1960s but now considered to range much more widely, refers to a type of filmmaking that exists in opposition to the Hollywood mainstream, and is defined as much by the means of distribution and exhibition as by a set of textual characteristics. Traditionally distributed by small independent companies, arthouse films are aimed at cineaste audiences and screened in alternative venues, such as independent or repertory cinemas, cinematheques, and galleries. As such, they are often associated with “culture” and “high art,” rather than “entertainment.” Having said this, independent and cult films that are often associated with “entertainment,” and which similarly exist outside the mainstream, also often find a home in arthouse cinemas and have much in common with the art film. Both largely emerged in opposition to the classical Hollywood system, which had come to dominate filmmaking practice, and the art film in particular enabled other national cinemas to establish their own indigenous style of filmmaking distinct from Hollywood (Bordwell 1979; Neale 1981). The one factor that scholars and industry practitioners agree on is that “art films are not mainstream Hollywood films” (Wilinsky 2001: 15).

Arthouse sf, therefore, refers to films made beyond mainstream Hollywood. As a result this category can apply equally to films made outside of the US, such as Solaris (Tarkovsky 1972) and Cube (Natali 1997), within the American independent sector such as Pi (Aronofsky 1998) and Primer (Carruth 2004), and as part of underground cult cinema such as Night of the Living Dead (Romero 1968), The Rocky Horror Picture Show (Sharman 1975), and Repo Man (Cox 1984). Furthermore, it is not necessarily distinguished by its narratives, for it can include many of the same types of sf story as are found in more mainstream fare, from space travel to dystopias. Instead, it integrates sf's established narrative or thematic preoccupations with the stylistic and artistic approaches of the art film. As Geoff King and Tanya Krzywinska point out, “Films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, La Jetée (1963), Alphaville (1965) and Born in Flames (1983) use science fiction to explore existential and/or political questions that were implicit in some of the films of the 1950s” (King and Krzywinska 2000: 6). Rather than embed such typical concerns within a seemingly spectacular and action-oriented filmmaking style, art cinema sf overtly explores the narrative complexities of and philosophical questions raised by the genre.

One of the key elements of art cinema is realism (real locations, problems, sexuality, and characterization) (Bordwell 1979: 57). While the genre is by its very nature speculative and often explores futuristic and/or fantasy narratives, such as time travel, space exploration, or alien visitation/invasion, arthouse sf's association with concepts of realism distinguishes it from more mainstream examples of the genre. The use of real locations is often mixed with realistically presented futuristic sets, creating a believable and recognizable environment in which to set the narrative. In so doing, arthouse sf often fosters a sense of genuine scientific speculation. For instance, while imagining what space travel might be like in the future, 2001 grounds its presentation within real experience. The journey to the orbiting lunar station is presented as a spaceflight, replete with attendants wearing Pan Am uniforms, serving refreshments, and defying the weightlessness of their environment through their gravity shoes. Presenting the future as a “realistic” or believable extension of the present provides the film with a sense of plausibility. This might be what the future will be like.

More significantly, arthouse sf draws from the art film its preference for psychologically complex characters and narrative ambiguity by emphasizing psychological motivation over cause-and-effect plot construction. As David Bordwell explains, “art cinema is less concerned with action than reaction” (Bordwell 1979: 58). For instance, Solaris begins on Earth in a recognizable country home as the scientist Kelvin prepares to leave his family and go on his mission to the eponymous planet. Other than a video-phone, the house is unencumbered with the gadgets and technology often central to sf mise en scène. The pacing of this sequence is slow, with little narrative action: Kelvin simply wanders his surroundings, contemplating thoughts about the journey and his family that remain unexpressed. The film, therefore, focuses its attention not upon its space-travel narrative but rather upon the character. In fact, it takes 41 minutes for Kelvin to get into space - a stark contrast to more mainstream films, such as Aliens (Cameron 1986). When he arrives at the space station orbiting Solaris, he finds a lived-in environment, not overly laden with technology and scientific apparatus but rather cluttered with debris and rubbish, reflecting the disoriented psychological state of the cosmonauts. The mise en scène is more concerned with inner psychology than an imagined future.

In The Man Who Fell to Earth (Roeg 1976), the alien Thomas Newton poses as a human in order to recover water for his dying planet and more importantly to save his own family. But rather than tracking him step by step as he amasses a fortune and builds the rocket ship necessary for him to return home, the film focuses on the impact of human existence upon his alien sensibilities. He is regularly physically overwhelmed by the speed and the violence of modern society, passing out as a result of the motion of an elevator and having to leave a Japanese restaurant because he is disturbed by the ferocity of a Kabuki performance. The violence of this sequence is enhanced by Nicolas Roeg's decision to intercut the performance with an aggressive sex scene, reinforcing the image of modern humanity as a hostile race. Finally, it is through the corruption and downfall of the alien, as he becomes desensitized to the world around him and addicted to both alcohol and the stimulus of modern media, that Roeg offers his most convincing commentary on what it means to be human.

Similarly, Tarkovsky uses Solaris's first-contact narrative to explore questions about memory, guilt, and remorse. Rather than develop an overt first-contact story as seen in many Hollywood films from The Day the Earth Stood Still (Wise 1951) to Star Trek: First Contact (Frakes 1996), which present the first encounter between humans and aliens as either a direct meeting or an alien invasion, Solaris's first contact is metaphysical. Following experiments upon the oceans of Solaris, the crew of the station are haunted by corporeal visitations of people from their past. The scientists speculate that the planet's ocean is alive and has read their dreams in order to produce living specters from their past, including Kelvin's dead wife Hari, as a means of communication. In this manner, the film is less interested in the encounter with the “aliens” than in the psychological impact of the “visitors” upon the cosmonauts. As Steve Neale points out, the art film is often categorized by the “interiorisation of dramatic conflict” (Neale 1981: 13). In Solaris, this is manifested in the muted and introspective Kelvin. His initial reaction to the impossible sight of his dead wife is one of fear and revulsion, conveyed not through histrionics but rather his decision to eject her into space. However, when she reappears the next day he becomes increasingly preoccupied by her, but does not question how and why she can be there. Through her, he explores his own remorse for his role in the demise of their relationship and her subsequent suicide. Furthermore, as she becomes aware that she is not the real Hari, the film also focuses upon questions of humanity and the nature of being. If she is not Hari, then who is she? As with most arthouse sf, Solaris does not provide any clear answers to the many questions it poses, but instead uses the genre as a means of exploring these existential themes.

Arthouse sf is further identified by its visual aesthetics. Neale suggests that in the art film, there is a “stress on visual style,” but not the “institutionalised spectacle” we associate with the Hollywood mainstream, but rather a personal form of creative expression (Neale 1981: 13). This can be seen in a more reflective and minimalist visual style than is found in blockbuster sf. The pacing is usually slow, the camera is observational, and the images do not necessarily progress the plot but instead often emphasize a certain poetic beauty. This approach often highlights the wondrous aspects of the genre and the artistic sensibilities of the director, as moments of spectacle or design are showcased. In 2001, Kubrick privileges artistic spectacle for its own sake as the minor plot point about one ship docking at a space station is transformed into a cinematic ballet. In this sequence, the narrative pauses as the ship's circling of the station, accompanied by Johann Strauss's Blue Danube, is visually presented as a waltz. In George Lucas's THX 1138 (1971), it is the art direction that conveys the director's minimalist vision for his dystopian future, while the “characters are at times reduced to dark silhouettes picked out against a blinding white background suggestive of a sterile, undifferentiated world in which individuality and love are suppressed” (King and Krzywinska 2000: 76). In Alphaville, Jean-Luc Godard uses jumpcuts and a disjunctive editing style, consistent with his French New Wave origins, alongside the graphic composition of modern architecture, set design, and expressionist chiaroscuro to convey his vision of an emotionally detached, technologically governed society.

This more contemplative style also encourages the audience to reflect upon the images that they see and to consider their meaning. Gone, for the most part, are the cinematic indicators that highlight significant elements so as to facilitate a clear understanding of the narrative. Instead, “audience members must work to keep up and figure out what is happening in such films” (Wilinsky 2001: 19). This approach to sf opens the genre to metaphysical speculation rather than the more grounded scientific rationale. This is best exemplified in the experimental time-travel film La Jetée (Marker 1963). Structured as a photomontage, the film is composed almost exclusively of still images of a man so haunted by an image of a woman from his childhood that he is able to escape from an apocalyptic future and into the past to meet her. While the broad strokes of the plot are clearly conveyed in the film's narration, little exposition is given to the science of time travel and the film's meaning is left to the audience to unravel by contemplating the juxtaposition of this series of still images. Capturing in its form the fleeting experience of time and memory, La Jetée haunts the audience with glimpses of the future and the past and leaves the significance of the film's one moving image unexplained. Like Solaris, it is to the subjective experience of memory that arthouse sf turns.

In contrast to the conventional approach to visuals used by the art film, independent and cult films frequently offer a more gritty and confrontational aesthetic that serves to undermine the high-art associations of the genre and as such appeal to a youth audience. The low-budget special effects and documentary filmmaking techniques of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead create a vision of an apocalypse in which the dead, resuscitated through nuclear radiation, return to feed off the living. Alex Cox, on the other hand, presents his comic tale of a radioactive car in Repo Man with a punk, irreverent sensibility through his use of contemporary music, fluorescent colors, cartoonish special effects, and a dead-pan performance style that reinforces the film's opposition to mainstream cinema and the art film. Tsukamoto Shinya's cyberpunk Tetsuo (1989) uses fast and disjunctive editing, grainy film stock, and discordant sound effects and music to explore the physical horror and violence of cyborg existence, while Darren Aronofsky's Pi adopts a similar style to offer a glimpse into the mind of a mathematician. The visuals may be different but these films, as well as the low-budget time-travel film Primer, share with more classical examples of arthouse sf the preoccupation with using the genre to convey a subjective perception of the world, science, and technology. In so doing, they remind us that this subgenre is constantly evolving and changing, in terms of both aesthetic and narrative conventions, even as sf's central preoccupations persist. What binds all of these films together is that they explore what it means to be a human in a scientifically and technologically determined world and they do so, not by creating advanced imagined cities or communities - although they can do that as well - but by conveying the subjective experience of a world in which our understanding of humanity is changing every day.",,2137958649,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Abbott, Stacey"," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

50. Eutopia (Part IV Subgenres),"The literary eutopia, or positive utopia, is “a non-existent society described in considerable detail and normally located in time and space that the author intended a contemporaneous reader to view as considerably better than the society in which the reader lived” (Sargent 1994: 9). “Eutopia,” a pun on “eu” (good) + “topos” (place) as well as “ou” (no) + “topos” (place), is not, nor was it ever intended to be, an identifiable place. Indeed, vagueness about location is a common strategy in narratives about these alternative communities. For example, in Thomas More's Utopia (1516), although Raphael Hythloday describes the geographical features of the crescent-shaped eponymous isle, he never explicitly locates it. Geographic isolation and distance have then become mainstays of eutopian narratives. This is perhaps not surprising; after all, the

“discovery” of the non-European continents and islands provided visionaries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries with actual and imaginary space in which to create both practicing and literary experiments. The new space in the world reinforced the sensibility found in the landscape painting and pastoral poetry of the time that effused the presence of an arcadian locale in which dreams could be lived.
(Moylan 1986: 3)
Francis Bacon's New Atlantis (1627) deploys similar arcadian tactics. Bacon's band of travelers, having set sail from Peru for China and Japan, quickly lose all sense of direction, are buffeted by powerful winds, and eventually traverse the “greatest wilderness of waters in the world” (Bacon 1999: 152) to find Bensalem, a scientifically advanced eutopia that remains hidden from the world while monitoring other societies' social and technological progress.

Having deposited their fictional travelers in alternative social communities, authors then critique their own society by offering social, political, legal, and ethical contrasts with these idealized, unattainable alternatives. Book One of More's Utopia, for example, is a dialogue among Hythloday, Giles, and More about the “ills of England” (Bruce 1999: xviii) in the sixteenth century, covering such topics as unjust land appropriation, political posturing, monarchical manipulation of currency, counterfeit pleasures, and the social causes of brothels, taverns, alehouses, and thievery (and the hanging of thieves). Hythloday then provides a contrast in his description of the Isle of Utopia and its social justice, founded chiefly on the elimination of private property, the egalitarian division of labor, and beneficial spin-off social changes.

The extent to which More is to be read as satire or blueprint is an argument that continues to fuel utopian scholars, but there is little doubt that Utopia is “a rebuke to contemporary European societies, which he rightly saw as appallingly unjust” (Wertheim 2002: 218). It “seems important to insist that it is equally mistaken to understand the text solely as a joke. It is not self-evidently true that Utopia's subordination of individual choice and happiness to the good of the community is a misguided ideal,” and while “Utopia may appear authoritarian, perhaps even totalitarian, it is worth remembering that it is not nearly so repressive as early modern England” in the limitations placed on freedom of speech, poverty's circumscription of people's future, the torturing of suspected traitors, and the capital punishment of petty thieves (Bruce 1999: xxvi).

Later literary eutopias - Bacon's New Atlantis, Tommaso Campanella's The City of the Sun (1602), Margaret Cavendish's The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing-World (1666) - took their cue from More's Utopia and offered social and political commentary couched in the dynamics of eutopian enclaves. For example, Bacon was keenly interested in codifying and systematizing “scientific enquiry” while also writing on “moral qualities . . . such as truth, envy, and love, or political matters, such as sedition, empire, and kingdoms” (Bruce 1999: xxviii). He depicts Bensalem's social dynamics and its scientific foundation, focusing on the scientistpriests of Salomon's House, a research institute “dedicated to the study of the Works and Creatures of God” (Bacon 1999: 167), whose scientific endeavors include experiments in coagulation, refrigeration, conservation of bodies, the artificial production of natural minerals and metals, the curing of disease, the prolongation of life, insulation, meteorology, conservation, water filtration, geometry, astronomy, and harmonics. Bensalem also sends Merchants of Light to the outside world “whose errand was only to give us knowledge of the affairs and states of those countries to which they were designed, and especially of the sciences, arts, manufactures, and inventions of all the world; and withal to bring unto us books, instruments, and patterns in every kind” (Bacon 1999: 167-8). Although the “epitome of Renaissance utopianism,” there is “nothing communistic” in Bensalem: it “heralds a return to orthodoxy” where men and women alike know “their place in the social order” (Wertheim 2002: 217, 223).

The literary eutopia came under increasing pressure from the industrialized social conditions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. After 1850, the systematic utopia that imagined structurally different social communities was replaced with the heuristic utopia, which “offered a strength of vision that sought to subvert or at least reform the modern economic and political arrangement from within” (Moylan 1986: 6). Tellingly, literary eutopias became increasingly science-fictional as the new century beckoned. Samuel Butler's anagrammatic Erewhon, or Over the Range (1872) is a utopian satire. It depicts the trials and tribulations of Mr Nosnibor as he finds and tries to understand the eponymous eutopian enclave. For sf readers, the most compelling part of Erewhon is probably “The Book of the Machines,” which explores the implications of Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859) for technology and progress. It offers “a serious perspective on the evolving world” and serves as a “shocking challenge to our ideas about the continuity or discontinuity existing between man and machines” (Mazlish 2002: 239, 238).

Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (1888) is perhaps the most important eutopia of the late nineteenth century. When it opens in 1887, protagonist Julian West is afflicted by labor disruptions that repeatedly delay the completion of his Boston residence and thus his marriage to Edith Bartlett. An insomniac, he sleeps in a subterranean vault that ensures absolute darkness and pure silence. One evening, he undergoes hypnosis to achieve sleep and an ensuing series of unfortunate circumstances leave him to awaken 113 years later when his bedroom is accidentally excavated. Having effectively time-traveled, he must acclimatize himself to this wonderful new - and explicitly eutopian - world. With the great-granddaughter of his former fiancée at his side, conveniently named Edith, and with whom he will eventually fall in love, West meticulously details the social dynamics of twenty-first-century Boston.

Looking Backward was immensely successful: it “sold in the millions, and it went global in more than twenty translations. Historians credit it with inspiring some forty or more other Utopian works, some . . . in direct” reply (Miller 2000: v). This is perhaps unsurprising. The US has, after all, a history of intentional utopian communities: the Shakers (United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing), a “celibate millenarian group that established communal settlements in the United States in the 18th century,” deriving social and spiritual direction from the “revelations of Ann Lee and her vision of the heavenly kingdom to come” (Encyclopædia Britannica); Brook Farm (1841-7), a 175-acre communal farm in Massachusetts partly influenced by Charles Fourier's utopian socialism and attracting interest from Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Margaret Fuller; or, those social communities inspired by B.F. Skinner's Walden Two (1948). Bellamy's fictional eutopia itself translated into effective real-world politics: enthusiasts “organized more than 162 Bellamy Clubs in the States alone . . . dedicated to transferring Bellamy's Utopia from fiction to fact” (Miller 2000: v-vi), contributing to the rise of the Nationalist Party, including two major magazines (The Nationalist, The New Nation), 50 other periodicals that were aligned with Nationalism, and “[i]n 1892, with Nationalist aid, Populists polled more than one million votes for president and elected three governors and several state legislators” (Miller 2000: vi).

Charlotte Perkins Gilman, who would later pen the feminist eutopia Herland (1915), “was drawn to Bellamy's emphasis on political, social, and economic equality and quickly became a convert to Nationalism . . . Gilman was particularly attracted by the novel's emphasis on women's rights and began actively advocating such social reforms as economic independence, the restructuring of the home and child-care practices” (Knight 1999: xi-xii). Herland deploys a familiar pattern: a group of male travelers “discover” (and name) the all-female Herland nestled in the mountains. While learning about new social dynamics - family is completely reconstructed since women reproduce through parthenogenesis - the men also struggle (with various consequences) with Herland's divorce from heteronormative gender codes. Yet, unlike many eutopian predecessors, Gilman's utopia strives to break its isolation by reincorporating men into their social system, albeit without adopting patriarchal gender-coding. Like a merchant of light, Ellador eventually leaves Herland with one of the men, Vandyck Jennings, to explore the outside world and report back on its social conditions, itself a depressing report. In With Her in Ourland (1916), Ellador and Van “travel the world during the Great War. At the conclusion of the novel, the disillusioned pair returns to the utopian Herland, which offers a sanctuary from the disease-infested, poverty-stricken, and decidedly inequitable masculine world” (Knight 1999: xv). Thus, if assessments of literary utopias have “to focus on the identification the reader is invited to make with the protagonist/narrator” (Varsam 2003: 205), there is little doubt about Gilman's eutopianism.

In the twentieth century, the positive utopia was overshadowed by the rising popularity and political efficacy of the dystopia (negative utopia), although eutopia's tropes did reappear in the feminist critical utopias of the 1960s and 1970s, exemplified by Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed: an ambiguous utopia (1974), Joanna Russ's The Female Man (1975), Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time (1976), Samuel Delany's Triton (1976), Suzy McKee Charnas's Motherlines (1978), and Sally Miller Gearhart's Wanderground: stories of the hill women (1980). Unlike the eutopia, the critical utopia retains “difficult problems that the described society may or may not be able to solve and which takes a critical view of the utopian genre” (Sargent 1994: 9). For example, Woman on the Edge of Time depicts Consuelo “Connie” Ramos as a welfare-dependent New York City Chicana whose prior history of child abuse (a solitary incident brought on by extremity rather than psychopathology) lands her back in a mental institution when, following a defensive assault on her pregnant niece's pimp-boyfriend, she is judged to be suffering from an ongoing mental instability. Connie is apparently visited by Luciente, a citizen of the future utopia, Mattapoisett, and learns how to travel there, although her body remains locked in Rockover State Psychiatric Hospital. Her travels entail a complete restructuring of her formative principles. She is repeatedly challenged by alternative economics, gender relations, sexuality, reproduction and childrearing practices, democracy, medicine, and even pronouns (“per” has replaced “he” and “she”). The most troubling aspect for Connie is the divesting of pregnancy and reproduction from the female body. Profoundly upset by the “brooders,” technological interventions into the reproductive process, she is initially mortified by the consequences: “She felt angry. Yes, how dare any man share that pleasure. These women thought they had won, but they had abandoned to men the last refuge of women. What was special about being a woman here? They had given it all up, they had let men steal from them the last remnants of ancient power, those sealed in blood and in milk” (Piercy 1976:134). Connie's uncertainty highlights Piercy's avoidance of “a simplistic, élitist image of utopian perfection and links utopia more closely with the uncertainties of history” (Moylan 1986: 152). It is never clear whether this near-future village is a “real” non-place or a figment of Connie's imagination, one that Connie must actively bring to fruition. For example, when she involuntarily undergoes the surgical implantation of a dialytrode to monitor and control her behavior, she loses contact with Mattapoisett and accesses a nightmarish near-future New York City controlled by multinational corporations and saturated with drugs, abuse, prostitution and women who are nothing more than a “cartoon of femininity” (Piercy 1976: 288). When the dialytrode is removed, she ends up in another alternate near-future, this time united with her Mattapoisett compatriots in a battle against enemies who appear as:

all the caseworkers and doctors and landlords and cops, the psychiatrists and judges and child guidance counselors, the informants and attendants and orderlies, the legal aid lawyers copping pleas, the matrons and EEG technicians, and all the other flacks of power who had pushed her back and turned her off and locked her up and medicated her and tranquilized her and punished her and condemned her. They were all closing in, guns blazing.
(Piercy 1976: 336)
Juxtaposed with the future New York and this nightmarish battlefront, Mattapoisett, in spite of its internal conflicts, evokes eutopia: “democratic, anarchist, communist, environmentalist, feminist, non-racist - where freedom and responsibility are balanced in a steady-state economy and non-repressive value system” (Moylan 1986: 134).

From More's Utopia to Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time and into the twenty-first century, the eutopia has had a long and varied career, its popularity ebbing and flowing with social changes and political dynamics but never entirely slipping into obsolescence. This may be because utopian authors and their literary texts assert “the power of desire as a mechanism of the collective human subject that cannot be totally denied or coopted, as an anticipation and practice of what could be as the current historical situation is negated” (Moylan 1986: 155). Just as the shape of political and social (in)justice has changed since More's groundbreaking Utopia, so eutopia has responded to and, more importantly, advocated change, catering “to our ability to dream, to recognize that things are not quite what they should be, and to assert that improvement is possible” (Sargent 1994: 26).",,2137958624,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Murphy, Graham J."," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

6. Coolie (Part I: Keywords),"Did the coolie exist? Yes and no. On one hand, there have been, since the sixteenth century, people called “coolies.” On the other, the word “coolie” names historically not a person but a type of work, or rather, an interface between personhood and work, mediated by race, that affected the global history of labor from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries. Though we can say that certain people have historically been called or have called themselves “coolies,” we can also say that the “coolie” has never really existed. Or if it has existed, it has only done so as a sociocultural concept whose various dimensions-historical, economic, racial, political, syntactic-make up a complex that could not have been, and were never, embodied in a single person or group of people.

Let us distinguish, then, between what history has called “a coolie,” meaning a single worker from India or China, usually recruited to do common or heavy labor in the Americas in the nineteenth century, and what it has called “the coolie,” a concept larger than any single worker, whose deployment in the economic and political language of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries constitutes a crucial part of transnational Asian American history. To put it in more forceful terms, the person called “a coolie,” or even the total collection of people so thought (“coolies”), should not be considered identical to the concept of “the coolie” that governed them. (Similarly, culture differentiates “an American” from “the American,” “a Negro” from “the Negro”; only the second of these uses will lend itself to adjectival formations like “the Negro problem,” or nominal ones like “Americanism.”) In this way “the coolie” has a strange relationship to the idea of the human person. Like the “slave,” which describes a kind of person who according to legal and practical use is less than a person, the “coolie” is a kind of person whose relation to work and to race marks him (for the figure of the coolie is male, if not unproblematically so) as less than human. At the same time, because the word refers to an entire complex of socially organized conceptions of labor and practices of being, the “coolie,” like the “slave,” also refers to something far greater than a single human person, who would be dwarfed by the immense history of hope, violence, economy, and politics that lie behind the word.

* * *

But all this is a perhaps unnecessarily convoluted and theoretical description of something whose historical existence, for students and scholars of Asian America, can also be described in simpler and more factual terms. The word “coolie” in the US context refers most simply to a kind of Asian worker, mainly Chinese, sometimes Indian or Japanese, who came to the United States and Latin America during the second half of the nineteenth century. Coolies, as they were known, came most often from southern China, and included both free workers and indentured or contract laborers-though in practice many free workers were treated as indentured ones, and indentured or contract ones as little more than slaves.

What caused the influx of coolie labor to the Americas? We should not imagine that the coolies were waiting there in China for something to do, that there was some mass of people called “coolies” who suddenly decided to cross the Pacific to find work. Rather, Chinese men who traveled to the Americas, or Indians who traveled to ports in the Caribbean or the Indian Ocean, became coolies the moment they set foot on the boats that ran the transpacific trade in Asiatic labor. (Though the word “coolie” was in some use in India to refer to certain classes of common laborer as early as the sixteenth century, there was no coolie trade, nor can there be said to have been a unique coolie culture, economy, or social formation, until the nineteenth century.) In this sense the most immediate cause of “the coolie” as a concept was the demand for labor in the United States, Peru, Brazil, and Cuba, where the vast majority of coolie workers ended up.

The causes of that demand were twofold. On the one hand, they owed a great deal to the British abolition of the slave trade (via the Slave Trade Act of 1807) and, a quarter-century later, of slavery itself throughout most of the British Empire (by the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833; the Act was extended to the British Empire in India in 1843). The subsequent interdiction of slave ships by the British navy, which made African slaves far more difficult to carry across the Atlantic, also exerted pressure on plantation owners to find alternate sources of labor. By the middle of the nineteenth century, owners from the United States to the Caribbean were discussing publicly the coming shortage of available workers.

In Cuba sugar planters attempted to recruit white labor from both Ireland and Spain in the 1840s, though in both cases the experiment proved unsuccessful. In 1847 the first group of 500 Chinese workers arrived on the island, where they were spread out among its major plantations. By 1855 the US consul to Cuba could report that, regardless of the merits of Chinese workers, their arrival had “at least lowered the price of slaves considerably,” a claim that shows us how clearly Chinese workers were understood to be taking part in a transnational economy of labor (Guterl 2003: 16). Chinese workers continued coming to Cuba until the trade in contract laborers there was banned in 1874; the contracts of this last set of migrants expired in the 1880s.

On the other hand, in the United States, discussions about the possible value of Chinese workers to plantation and factory owners also owed a great deal to the politics of slavery, though slavery remained legal in the southern states through the end of the Civil War in 1865. But Chinese migration to the United States began much earlier, with the first voluntary migrants coming in 1848, two years before California joined the Union, in response to the news of gold found loose in the scrubland hills. In that same year, as Moon-Ho Jung has noted, the word “cooly” moved “from the appendix to the main body of Noah Webster's American dictionary,” a sign of the changing status of the concept in American social life (Jung 2005: 679; see also Jung 2006). By the late 1850s, tens of thousands of Chinese migrants were toiling either as free miners or as contract laborers on the transcontinental railroad, and many had settled in the cities and small towns of the California coast. The lives of these mainly voluntary migrants-never especially pleasant, as they worked in hardscrabble conditions for less pay, and harsher treatment, than their white counterparts-can be contrasted with the truly dreadful conditions that awaited involuntary coolie workers, who were often drugged or kidnapped before being dropped into quasi-slavery conditions on plantations or in guano mines.

While conditions on the ground in the United States were rarely as bad as those in the Caribbean, US and British shipping firms participated extensively in the “carrying trade,” earning profits from the transport of Chinese and India workers to various ports in Brazil, Peru, and Cuba.1[1] International attention to the carrying trade increased significantly in 1852, when reports on a mutiny by Chinese workers being transported to San Francisco aboard the Robert Browne revealed that the conditions of that trade resembled in most respects the trade in slaves on the Atlantic. Not surprisingly, then, agitation against what became known as the “coolie trade” borrowed much of its language and moral force from abolitionist critiques of slavery, as we can see in this 1860 report of the US House of Representatives:

the coolie is seldom a party to any contract, but the subject of a contract made between parties seeking to derive, through deception and by fraud, unlawful gain by the barter, without his volition, of his skill and labor for a consideration not known to him and not intended to benefit him. From the moment of his capture the coolie is a slave.
(House of Representatives, 36th Congress, 1st Session April 16, 1860)
Other critiques of the international trade in Chinese workers took a different, more racist stance, arguing that the market for white workers needed to be protected from foreign, inferior competition. “No inferior race of men can exist in these United States without becoming subordinate to the will of the Anglo-Americans,” wrote anti-slavery activist Hinton Helper in 1855, while worrying that “the copper of the Pacific [would become] as great a subject of discord and dissension as the ebony of the Atlantic” (cited in Saxton 1995: 19). In sum, arguments against the coolie trade came from positions both sympathetic to and disdainful of the “inferior” Chinese workers; together these arguments, along with a desire to support the anti-slavery position taken by the Union during the Civil War, led Abraham Lincoln to sign in 1862 an act prohibiting US vessels from participating in the coolie trade and forbidding American citizens from helping to build, fit out, equip, or crew any vessel involved in it.

None of this kept Chinese workers from being seen as a potential solution to the labor crisis caused by the end of slavery. Formal interest in bringing Chinese workers to the United States for the express purposes of mitigating the “loss” of unfree African American work can be seen in the founding of the American Emigrant Company in 1863 in order to acquire Chinese “miners, mechanics (including workers in iron and steel of every class), weavers, and agricultural, rail-road and other laborers … in any numbers, and at a reasonable cost” (cited in Gyory 1998: 19). In 1869, the American entrepreneur Cornelius Koopmanschap, speaking to several hundred delegates at the nation's first convention on Chinese labor, offered “to import thousands of laborers from China for one hundred dollars a head,” Andrew Gyory writes. This “triggered a chain reaction of interest in importing Chinese workers” including orders from railroad owners in Tennessee and manufacturers from Ohio and Missouri (Gyory 1998: 31, 33-4).

The cultural and political status of Chinese workers in the United States changed significantly in the years after 1869. Partly this was due to the completion of the transcontinental railroad in that year, which freed tens of thousands of Chinese workers to pursue other job opportunities, mainly on the West Coast, where they suddenly began competing with white workers in a variety of professions. Partly it was due to the economic depression that began in 1873 and extended through the early 1880s, which forced manufacturers of all kinds to pursue new ways of reducing their costs, including labor costs. Such new “efficiencies” included the introduction of more and newer machinery, which tended to homogenize the types of work required for production, a change that belonged to the more general global-historical shift from craft to factory labor (see Lee 1999). This had the significant advantage, for manufacturers, of making workers more interchangeable, and hence jobs more competitive (driving down wages). Much less training (and ability) was required to operate a machine for making chairs than to actually craft them by hand, making it easier and cheaper to hire and train a new employee. Changes in the type of labor allowed manufacturers and producers to seek out “new sources of factory labor-women, children, and immigrants,” producing a vast expansion of the workforce and making far more dynamic and variable the conditions of employment (Lee 1999: 55). This was so not only because a fired worker could be easily replaced, but also because the new workers brought into the factory were from populations that were far more physically, socially, and legally vulnerable than their white male counterparts. They could thus be more easily pressured, fired, or abused.

As Robert Lee has shown, the transformation of free Chinese workers into “coolies” participated in a general racialization of common labor, in which certain kinds of work were defined as “white,” and others as “coolie” or “nigger” work. In the United States, members of the white working class found themselves standing precisely on top of the fault line that separated these forms of labor, as some “white” jobs moved, partly because of changes in manufacturing, into the “non-white” category, and as Chinese workers began to enter “white” industries or household service, where they competed with the most vulnerable members of the white working class, usually those who had already lost (or were incapable of finding) positions as craftsmen (Saxton 1995: 264).

The racialization of Chinese labor (and of the Chinese worker as a “coolie”), abetted by the increased number of Chinese workers and manufacturing strategies designed to increase competition among unskilled laborers, came together most vividly in California. There, two groups of recent immigrants to the United States, the Irish and the Chinese, found themselves in a vivid political conflict that did as much as anything else to help define the nature and typology of the coolie (and “coolie labor”) for an American audience for the rest of the nineteenth century and beyond. The Irish, as the United States' most recently arrived European immigrants, had struggled throughout the mid- and late 1800s to establish themselves as “white,” distinguishing themselves sharply from free African-Americans in order to place themselves on the privileged side of the color line. It was thus Irish labor union leaders and politicians who took the lead in attacking Chinese workers through proclamations and broadsides, and to organizing marches and, on occasion, violent attacks against Chinese workers. In 1877 anti-coolie feeling in California led to the foundation of the Workingman's Party, led by Denis Kearney, which became the vanguard for political agitation against Chinese workers and Chinese immigration. This agitation would lead, over the next three decades, to the series of Exclusion Acts and other ideological mechanisms designed to halt Chinese immigration to the United States (see Hsuan Hsu's chapter on “Nineteenth-Century Orientalisms” in this volume). The entire history of American immigration law thus owes its origins to the mythology of the coolie and the racialized clash between vulnerable groups of immigrants.

* * *

From our perspective today, what is perhaps most interesting about the figure of the coolie is the degree to which the coolie's racial logic was married to an economic one. Both before and after their arrival in the “new” world, coolies were the subjects of comparative analyses that brought together racial logics with perceptions of the new economic modes of factory work that came to displace, in the late nineteenth century, earlier forms of “craft” production. This meant that coolie workers represented not only a racial, foreign threat to the well-being and economic stability of existing, “native” communities of laborers-including emancipated slaves or more recently arrived immigrants from Ireland or Eastern Europe-but that they also came to stand in for the general disenfranchisement of individual workers or small, craft-oriented businesses in the face of shifts toward mass production. Time and time again the features of the type of work coolies were brought in to do were conflated with imaginary features of the type of worker the coolie was. This interpenetration of the logic of race with the logic of economic development is one of the signature features of coolie discourse, especially in the United States, where coolies had much more freedom than they did in Cuba or Peru to move out of heavy or common labor on plantations, railroads, and mines and into fields like cigar-making, household service, or laundry.

The fear of an “invasion” of Chinese workers, known as the Yellow Peril (addressed elsewhere in this volume by Hsuan Hsu and Timothy Yu), involved not simply the fear of a newly or differently racialized America, but anxieties about the general transformation of the field of work and capital into a transnational economy dominated by automatons and machines. Colleen Lye has remarked on the ways in which this general cultural anxiety reversed the usual structural binary whereby the Racial and the Primitive finds itself associated with the Past, and the White and the Modern with the Future. In fin-de-siècle California, it was the primitive coolie who stood in for a manufacturing-oriented future, and the white worker for an idyllic, republican past. The coolie thus figured a global trend toward the mitigation of individual skill and physical ability, and thus threatened not only a newly racial world-situation but a newly proletarian one. Chinese workers, union organizers and China experts argued, were somehow physically suited-at a racial level-to the demands of the new kinds of factory work.2[1] Lower wages paid to Chinese workers made sense because they only ate rice, not meat, James G. Blaine told the US Senate in 1879: “You cannot work a man who must have beef and bread, and would prefer beef, alongside of a man who can live on rice. In all such conflicts, and in all such struggles, the result is not to bring up the man who lives on rice to the beef-and-bread standard, but it is to bring down the beef-and-bread man to the rice standard” (cited in Gompers 1902: 5). The coolie's threat was not just to take a job from the German or Irish immigrant, but to “degrade” the status of labor and thus to bring the beef-and-bread worker down to his level. In the long run this presaged nothing more than the destruction of the independent white working class and the total remaking of the American economy, as we see in Edward Ross's 1901 vision of “the silent replacement of Americans by Asiatics [which would] go on unopposed until the latter monopolize[d] all industrial occupations” (“The Causes of Race Superiority,” essay cited in Lye 2005: 56).

(When it came to the general fear or proletarianization the union organizers were not wrong-the transnationalization of labor markets, and the migration of cheap and vulnerable immigrant labor, were quite explicitly an aspect of the development of the US manufacturing and plantation economy in those years. And if you feel like you recognize in this picture something of the way things still operate today: well, that's why we read history.)

The Chinese worker was thus seen as relatively weaker, relatively less in need of food, and relatively able to sustain monotonous, repetitive labor, and thus as an incessant drag on the “natural” viability of the white worker. This effect on the individual worker, union organizers argued, would metastasize to cover the entire apparatus of American civilization, which would be undermined or sucked dry by the replacement of good old “American” values with “Chinese” ones. Not for nothing were Chinese workers often compared to insects: they were simultaneously sub- and superhuman, able to join the minor and easily dismissible qualities of the individual insect (small, insignificant) into the massive and terrifying qualities of a swarm, whose combination of infinitesimal inputs could threaten the destruction of an entire social and biological ecosystem. “The coolie” thus gave us a strange paradox of power: contemptible and historically irrelevant individually or in small numbers, it acquired, at certain levels of multiplication and scale, a world-transformative power that threatened to set the train of history onto radically new, Chinese rails.

Resistance to Chinese labor also owed something to claims that Chinese migrants were merely “sojourners” in the United States, people who could and would never assimilate into American society, who were committed to returning home and therefore uninterested in contributing economically or socially to an American polity. (That the intention to return home often stemmed from the fact of severe legal restrictions on the immigration of Chinese women-designed to keep Chinese workers from creating families in the United States-did not, somehow, interfere with the accusation.) It also owed something to the stereotype of the Chinese man as docile, sexless, even feminine, unlikely to struggle against abuse or fight for better working conditions. The extension of this stereotype was connected in Asiatic racial discourse to physical features of the Chinese migrants-including the tendency of the men to wear their hair, Manchu-style, in a long queue at the back of the head-and to their economic roles in certain industries, especially laundry and household service, where they frequently replaced white female workers (by one estimate, in 1900, one of four employed Chinese men in the United States worked in the laundry business) (Takaki 1998: 93).

Of course actual Chinese “coolies” did resist, did strike, did fight back against their working conditions, did struggle to improve their lives in the United States-another sign of their distance from the figure of “the coolie” under which they lived. Chinese workers on the transcontinental railroad struck in 1867 to demand they be paid the same wages as their white counterparts; cigar makers struck in 1877, prompting the Labor Standard to remark that “in joining the strike, the Chinese 'showed themselves capable of real civilization'” (Gyory 1998: 98); farm laborers in Santa Clara County struck in 1880; and so on. In recent years scholars have begun to uncover evidence that even the most vulnerable Chinese workers in the Americas, including those on Cuban plantations or Peruvian guano mines, engaged in significant acts of rebellion and resistance designed to change their working conditions. Joseph Dorsey notes that though “theft and sabotage were rare among the Chinese [in Cuba] compared with other workers … suicide was spectacular,” with over 500 workers a year taking their own lives between 1850 and 1872 (compared to thirty-five a year among slaves) (Dorsey 2004: 26). Dorsey also tracks 312 cases of homicide by Chinese workers, showing how migrants “killed in the name of liberation, stabilizing self-improvement, or temporary relief” (30). Lisa Yun has also studied resistance and self-empowerment among Chinese workers in Cuba and the southern United States. Her research includes a number of legal depositions and mass petitions by Chinese workers, which she connects to the historical traditions of witnessing and testimonio. “The tropes of witnessing and naming,” she writes, “ the desire to speak for the dead, the prevalence of group perspective ('we,' 'us,' and 'our'), and the narrating of collective actions, signal the formation of collective identity in the act of giving testimony” (181). This “collective resistance through writing,” Yun argues, shows us a more complex picture of Chinese laborers than the one we get if we simply consider them as the pure victims of economic, social, cultural, and racial violence. Though we cannot forget that violence, we must also recognize that the full story of Chinese migrant workers in the Americas included many instances of triumph, solidarity, and success, none of which is adequately captured by the concept of the “coolie” as the nineteenth century knew it.

* * *

Is there a coolie today? Certainly no one uses the word, though it seems to persist in popular culture as the name for a certain kind of hat (or a lampshade shaped like one). Nonetheless we can identify many of the same structural and economic factors that created “the coolie” operating in our culture in the early twenty-first century. This is certainly so in relation to labor in general, where the recent history of the global economy, with its ever-widening gap between the haves and have-nots, and the increasing share of global wealth controlled by a tiny minority of its population, open up the possibility of a fully proletarianized, ape-like workforce controlled by a quasi-super-species of educated, genetically enhanced, mainly white financiers and manufacturers and their families. But that's the stuff of science fiction-in fact it's the plot of H.G. Wells's 1895 The Time Machine, an imaginary of a future dystopia that registered all too well the actual anxieties of people living through the manufacturing shifts of the 1890s.

Less spectacularly, we can note how significant changes in the global economy since the 1960s have produced a new situation of world labor distribution, in which East and Southeast Asian economies function as the primary manufacturers for US- or Europe-based transnational corporations like Nike, Apple, or Nokia. While what we saw in the case of “the coolie” had to do with the transnationalization of labor markets via the movement of people, what we have seen in the post-World War II period is the transnationalization of labor markets via the movement of factories. It is far cheaper-and causes far less social disruption-to move the factory to East Asia and to pay workers there far less than their US counterparts might make in order to maximize profits and minimize labor costs, while taking advantage of the willingness of poorer countries to exploit their environments (and people) more readily than the highly developed countries of the West.

On one hand, as economists would tell you, the result of this kind of trade in labor (which is just a subset of the trade in any other good) is, in general, more wealth all around-more wealth for the people buying the products, and more wealth for the people (and the countries) that make them. That so many Americans today can afford iPhones (or, indeed, decent furniture) certainly owes something to their relative cheapness; and the improvements that iPhones and furniture bring into our lives (connectedness; information; aesthetic pleasure) would not be nearly as widely distributed were Apple not able to take advantage of the global economy to purchase the phone's various components (including its labor) as cheaply as possible. Similarly, the economic growth of the so-called Asian Tigers-Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea-and the concomitant increases in wealth, health, education, or opportunities for women in those countries since the 1970s have owed a great deal to their capacity to manufacture goods for the rest of the world. And in the People's Republic of China, where more people have moved out of poverty in the last twenty years than have ever moved out of poverty in the history of human civilization, the growth of manufacturing plants has played a vital role in the radical transformation of economic and social opportunity available to hundreds of millions.

These positive changes have of course been accompanied by terrible consequences, many involving the use and abuse of vulnerable laboring populations. In the PRC, for instance, the extensive development of factories in which young women sleep in locked and guarded dorms, have their restroom breaks controlled, and commit suicide at disturbingly high rates, have prompted protests, investigations, and calls for boycotts and reform. A series of worker suicides at a Foxconn plant in Shenzhen in 2010 drew widespread condemnation of working conditions from global media outlets; in September 2012 a worker riot at another Foxconn facility, this one employing 79,000 people, closed down that factory for over a week (Barboza and Bardsher 2012). Anthropologist Pun Ngai, who lived and worked for eight months among workers at a Shenzhen factory, traced the impact of working conditions on the dagongmei, the young women, mostly migrants from the Chinese countryside, who have helped China become the “factory of the world” (see Ngai 2005). In keeping with the lessons learned from the history of nineteenth-century workers in Cuba, Louisiana, Peru, California, Massachusetts, Brazil, and indeed of workers the world over engaged in the struggle to control their lives, Ngai and her collaborators have interpreted recent increases in worker protests as signs that “workers are developing higher levels of class awareness and identification that make them more capable of forming mutual support networks based on shared interests,” which may help them change the political and economic conditions governing their lives and their work (Ngai et al. 2010: 146). In this discovery of the possibility of resistance among dagongmei-or in our recognition, prompted by a film like Jia Zhangke's The World (2004), of the tremendous toll economic growth always takes on society's most vulnerable populations-we are reminded once again that the lessons of history, like the figure of the coolie, offer our best opportunities for both despair and hope. Despair, because we are so often so terrible to each other; hope, because in terrible conditions we nonetheless find, again and again, those small acts of solidarity and politics that aspire to the day that some other, better set of values comes to sustain and comfort us.",,2137947612,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Hayot, Eric"," © 2014, 2016 Rachel C.

8. Cybernetics (Part I: Literatures and Sciences),"Come, let us hasten to a higher plane,
When dyads tread the fairy fields of Venn,
Their indices bedecked from one to n,
Commingled in an endless Markov chain!
(Lem 1985: 52)
In Stanislaw Lem's Cyberiad, the cybernetic super-engineer Trurl, robotic inventor and robot builder, constructs a robot-computer that can produce poetry in all its forms. He realizes that in order to produce the first-ever specimen of such a machine, he needs to model the whole of human mythological, social, and cultural history. So, he creates a cybernetic model of the Muse, a Cyberbard that can produce an infinite amount of heart-touching poems. Writing day and night, this immense poetic force ends up disturbing social as well as galactic order. The verse above - the first in a mathematical love poem with cybernetic feeling made by Trurl's electronic bard - is a fitting place to start a discussion of cybernetics and literature.

The mathematician Norbert Wiener, who coined the term, described “cybernetics” as the science of control and communication in the animal and the machine (Wiener 1948), a definition taken as foundational by one of cybernetics' major developers, Ross Ashby (1956). The etymology of cybernetics goes to the art of steersmanship. In Greek, kybernetes means pilot, steersman, and cybernetics is a theory of control of the behavior of machines, organisms, and organizations by the way of feedback circuits. Most of all, cybernetics studied machines with built-in devices, such as regulators and thermostats, for seeking and maintaining set goals. Thus, fundamentally, the science of cybernetics focuses not on being but on behavior: it does not ask, “what is this thing?” but instead, “what does it do?” Or, “how can we make a thing that does this?” Especially in its initial or first-order form, cybernetics is a transdisciplinary engineering thinking. It is not about subjective individuals or any form of individual consciousness, because one of the basic requirements for being an autonomous individual is to be autopoietic. As developed in second-order cybernetics, autopoiesis refers to systems, such as living cells, that are self-referential in that they are self-maintaining: they are themselves the product of their own operation (see Clarke 2008, and his article on Systems Theory, Chapter 19, this volume). In contrast, the machines studied in the first cybernetics are allopoietic, that is, created and made by something else, some other system.

The combination of a cybernetic machine and an organism, human or otherwise, is called a cyborg, from which term derives the fantastic cybernetic vision of the Borg in Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG). When Captain Jean-Luc Picard is captured by the Borg, he is transformed into a cyborg. The indeterminate status and behavior of this combination of machine and organism may be why in all the movies and TV episodes of TNG, Data, an android constructed by the chief cybernetician Dr. Noonien Soong, is such a mystery. Nobody knows exactly what it/he is or how to construct another. The Borg manifests as a juggernaut of cybernetically enhanced humanoid drones of multiple species, an interconnected collective communicatively linked through a subspace domain and integrated into a hive or group mind/ego, a single consciousness occupying many bodies. A type of organization inspired by bees and ants, as in a perfect dictatorship, the individual is sacrificed to the social whole. The Borg captures the uneasy social affect in many of the fantastic narratives cybernetics has inspired.

The cyborg fantasy of the Borg combines the autopoietic and sign-producing abilities of living systems with machines' powers of memory and computation, making all members of Borg far stronger than humans. Furthermore, as a massive cybernetic and homeostatic system, the Borg is always adapting and consuming new technology and information, making organic agencies into cyborgs with implants, and integrating those cyborgs and their spaceship into a sentient autopoietic system. The Borg travels through space assimilating those races and their technologies that can improve its efficiency and survival into its system: “We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile!” In “The Best of Both Worlds,” it captures and renders Captain Picard into the collective by surgically altering him, creating Locutus of Borg to use as a weapon in the battle against the Enterprise. One wonders if his recapture by the Enterprise crew and the operative restoration of his former individual self is as realistic as his submission to the Borg system!

Lem's genius in the Cyberiad is that, while he sees the immense possibilities of cybernetics, at the same time, with tongue-in-cheek irony, his exquisite science-fiction fables explore its dubious relations to human consciousness. In a fable on the problem of will, “Trurl's Machine,” a stupid and stubborn robot refuses to learn anything beyond its original program. Unfortunately, that program had some elementary flaws, such as thinking that two and two equals seven, and Trurl's stupid machine prefers to kill the messenger of its faults rather than to correct them. A fundamentalist robot! Isaac Asimov has a comparable story where robots on a space ship will not accept that they are created by the humans, pointing out how much more perfect they are. The movie I Robot uses the same kind of irony when the machines realize how irrational human beings can be, and so interpret Asimov's laws for robots about protecting their creators by trying to take power, thus bringing themselves and the whole globe into danger. As too often happens in these science fictions, the robots are given self-conscious minds, without due consideration of the flaws in cybernetic thinking - its blind spots when it comes to matters of will, emotion, the qualia and agency of first-person consciousness.

Cybernetics started by being closely associated with physics, in particular, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. But it depends in no essential way on the laws of physics or on the properties of matter. It gets its transdisciplinary scope by viewing the materiality of a given system as irrelevant to its organizational properties. Rather, it works with those circulating differences and relations that we have come to call information. What cybernetics is concerned with is the scientific investigation of all varieties of goal-oriented systemic processes, including such phenomena as regulation, information processing, information storage, adaptation, self-organization, self-reproduction, and strategic behavior. Cybernetics deals with all forms of behavior insofar as they are regular, determinate, or reproducible.

Thus, at its origin cybernetics lays down its own foundations as a science of self-regulating and goal-seeking systems. Lem underscores this special independence in his Cyberiad again and again by showing how Trurl and his friend and competitor, Klapaucius, are at the same time both inventors and problem solvers for the problems their inventions create. For instance, they invent a prey robot for King Krool so perfect that not even his predator Saint Cybernards and Cyberman pinchers, nor even the king's high-fidelity cybersteed, could follow it! In essence, Trurl and Klapaucius introduced self-organizing principles into their invention and, as such, attempted to move the behavior of robots up to the next step in cybernetic development, namely Heinz von Foerster's second-order cybernetics, for which the goal is not only to observe the behavior of systems but also to observe the way that observing systems observe. Thus the construction recurs on the constructor itself.

Lem's refined ironic tales, then, play on how cybernetic devices - from thermostats, physiological mechanism for the regulation of body temperature, and automatic steering devices, to economic and political processes - are goal-seeking systems studied under a general mathematical model of deviation-counteracting feedback networks. Cybernetics is transdisciplinary and requires some knowledge of neurophysiology, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, but proposes on this basis a general theory of information processing and decision making based on a computational framework. Laying the foundation for what we now call cognitive science, cybernetics' algebraic information thinking permeated even its attempts to model linguistics as well as emotions and consciousness.

This algebraic-computational orientation makes it clear why, in The Cyberiad, Klapaucius attempts to test Trurl's Cyberbard by asking for “a love poem, lyrical, pastoral, and expressed in the language of pure mathematics. Tensor algebra mainly, with a little topology and higher calculus, if need be. But with feeling, you understand, in the cybernetic spirit” (Lem 1985: 51-52). As cybernetics, especially in Wiener's hand, was also the development of a special interdisciplinary mathematical apparatus, the love poem given by Trurl's electronic bard, in Michael Kandel's astonishing translation, provides such a unique ode to mathematical beauty that I have to cite a few more lines.

Come, every frustum longs to be a cone,
And every vector dreams of matrices.
Hark to the gentle gradient of the breeze:
It whispers of a more ergodic zone.
In Riemann, Hilbert or in Banach space
Let superscripts and subscripts go their ways.
(Lem 1985: 52)
Because numerous systems in the living, social, and technological world may be translated into these mathematical and behavioral idioms, cybernetics cuts across many traditional disciplinary boundaries. It developed a metadisciplinary language of information and goal-oriented self-organized behavior through negative feedback that works on differences and uses feedback/feed-forward mechanisms to home in on the target. Cybernetic theory was derived to some extent from the new findings in the 1930s and 1940s regarding the role of electric signals in biological systems, including the human nervous system. Wiener (1948) connected information and entropy with organization and therefore evolution. Wiener defined information as a probability, describing the amount of information mathematically as an integral, a measurement of probability. Specifically, he defined information on the model of negentropy, as inspired by Erwin Schrödinger - the amount of entropy a system exports to keep its own entropy low (see Chapter 13 on Information Theory).

Wiener's view of information is thus that it contains some form of structure, order, or pattern. Many researchers attempt to build up a concept of meaning on this foundation. But such a concept of meaning does not have much to do with what living systems and human beings do to operate semiotically in cognition and communication. Lem underlines this gap when his hero, Trurl, realizes that, to be able to make poetry that actually touches human emotions, you have to possess some knowledge of the history of human culture, some sense of humanity's world horizon. In the most humorous way, Trurl works hard to squeeze the whole history of biological evolution and human development into logical programming and hardware construction. After that comes of course a little programming of semantics, grammar, pragmatics, and all the forms of poetry previously developed, plus an anti-cliché program - no problem for a great cybernetician! Clearly, Lem is mocking the technological hubris of some cybernetically inspired engineers.

Star Trek: TNG brings up Data's inability to understand jokes, including practical jokes, many times. Finally, he gets an “emotion chip.” But this throws him into a chaotic reality, a life-world of feelings he cannot control, and in one episode he actually requests to have it removed. Trurl's Cyberbard, on the other hand, learns to manipulate human feelings by the composition of words and meanings. Thus it is able to prevent its own destruction by the policemen and soldiers sent to pull its plug, overwhelming them with sentimental emotions, making them unable to do their grim deed. But of course the great question underlying Lem's short story is whether it is possible to teach a machine, if it lacks those emotions itself, to improvise the manipulation of human feelings. Even psychopaths, in order to manipulate others, operate from a minimum of feelings themselves. However, the therapeutic AI program Eliza and Paro, the robotic baby seal used to comfort demented elderly, seem to indicate that such interactions are possible to a certain extent. Taking cybermanipulation to the next level, the Cyberiad presents a “femfatalatron, an erotifying device, stochastic, elastic and orgiastic, and with plenty of feedback” (Lem 1985: 108). While, in Lem, the description is thick with irony, sex with female androids is featured in both Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and its movie adaptation, Blade Runner (1982). Today a whole industry is working on developing cybernetic sex machines.

Inspired by the original cybernetic work on neuropsychology and the brain as a logical programmer, the theory of a universal “language of mind” has been developed. Such a language of mind, it is hypothesized, would be what the brain computes in and then later translates to humans' culturally influenced natural language. It seems that this is what the TNG writers were inspired by when they imagined the Borg to use alphanumeric code as their written language, consisting of circular symbols with geometric shapes cut out of them, written in horizontal and vertical lines, for encoding and transmitting data throughout the Collective. Some parts of cybernetic cognitive science take it to be their role to unravel this brain-internal language in order to make artificial-intelligence, automatic decision-making systems, as well as an automatic universal language translator. One prototype is now called Babelfish. This term was coined by Douglas Adams in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Here the Babelfish is a small, fishlike creature from another galaxy, which you insert into your ear, with the result that you understand all other languages as if they were your own, no matter from which galaxy in the universe they come. But these days, it is the name of a free and automatic translation program on the Net, amazing in itself, but also, in its deficiencies, demonstrating the lack of robot language processing in relation to human meaning and understanding. The Babelfish has not yet reached the level of Trurl's Cyberbard.

The ideas that our brains are organic hardware or wetware - that our intelligence and cognitive abilities as well as our personalities are the informational programs that run on that wetware - have given rise to the vivid fantasy of transferring the human self out of its body and into other media. Most famous is William Gibson's groundbreaking cyberpunk trilogy Neuromancer, Count Zero, and Mona Lisa Overdrive (the so-called Sprawl trilogy), starting in 1984. It promotes the idea of “jacking in” to the Net. As you fasten the electrons of your Web-connected computer directly onto brain switches in your skull, your mind travels into the three-dimensional informational world of cyberspace. In this virtual reality, the mind of a deceased important person - for instance, the previous leader of a huge international concern - is present, together with huge artificial intelligences that evolve and expand their domination of this cyber-world, intricately connected to our material world through all the computers connected to real-world machines. Here is a new form of earthly paradise, as you can live forever on the Net without your body. This is in contrast to the Matrix movies: to be present in the Matrix, your mind has to have its base in a sleeping body kept alive by machines.

The Japanese cartoon Yoko Tsuno plays, in several issues, with the idea of transferring the human mind to robotic systems. The famous Japanese cartoon movie The Ghost in the Shell further explores this gray territory between living systems and independent artificial intelligences similar to human subjects but without a body. But most surprisingly, in what one supposes to be his alternative to those grand narratives of modernity he had previously mocked, Jean-François Lyotard, in his Postmodern Fables (1999), imagines the human species to escape when the sun burns out, departing from the Earth in space rockets as pure informational intelligences.

As Winograd and Flores (1987) pointed out, cybernetic developers in the 1980s expected to have intelligent robots managing human social tasks within a decade. The body was considered a machine in which the brain functioned by algorithmic computation. The modern computer was a perfect rational being. All we needed was to develop it into a still more powerful machine with more computing power. The funniest, most sarcastic and most penetrating critical evaluation of AI's relation to the human world of existential meaning ever written, in my opinion, is Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. After seven and a half million years' cybermeditating on “the ultimate question of the meaning of life, the universe and everything,” a supercomputer by the name of “Deep Thought” comes up with the answer: “42” (Adams 1996: 120). Computers, having no sense of human existential meaning, function in a mathematical universe.

Filled with scientific knowledge about the universe on one hand, and reflections - in the form of humorous events - on the role of emotion and meaning in human rationality on the other, this unique book purveys humorous and sarcastic scenarios about what could happen if developments in technology made it possible for us to install these “features” in computers and robots. We have seen similar discussions in Star Trek: TNG around the android Data, who gets an “emotion chip” from his human handlers. A number of scenarios play out the attempts of this rational android to deal with these new sensual aspects of reality - including the affect of humor. A comparable theme takes a different turn in Dick (1968) and Blade Runner (1982). The novel is deeply psychological, asking questions such as: What is empathy and human emotion? Is consciousness an emergent quality? What defines intelligence? The movie is a little cruder, of course, but its focus is the question of when the artificial life of androids stops being merely mechanical and becomes the feeling and willing of subjects with existential and aesthetic needs.

Dick's novel imagines that our culture has developed a cybernetic emotion-regulating machine capable of securing for its user a good mood all the time. But people start to get bored with happiness. To render happiness more enjoyable, they begin to play with inducing depressive states for longer and longer periods, some, unfortunately, for so long that they commit suicide. The Star Trek writers are aware of the related problem of the need for experiental embodiment in order to produce and sustain consciousness. In the Star Trek movie First Contact, the Borg Queen wants to persuade Data to join the Borg by tempting him with the addition of living flesh to his previously insensitive android body, thus transferring the feeling of a living body to his “brain.” The experience is as overwhelming for him as when he had an emotion chip inserted. But after all, the question ignored by these fantasies is how he could have experiences of any sort with a computer for a brain. We do not even know how living brains produce experience, nor if that is what they do.

In The Hitchhiker's Guide, Adams's deeply depressed super-robot, Marvin, deals in a sarcastic way with unreal techno-optimist expectations by showing some of the absurd consequences of emotions in supercomputer robots. Marvin can cause any cybernetic control system to break down completely just by connecting to it and sharing his melancholy view of the world and his own situation, and actually saves the book's young hero once by doing just that. But I also cherish the part where Marvin causes the cybernetically regulated high-speed elevators going up 100-storey houses to get anxiety neuroses and hide in the cellar, not daring to go up into the heights!

In the novel This Perfect Day (1970), Ira Levin plays out the question of the superiority of artificial to human intelligence and the consequences of improving nature and culture, through the control of a central computer. In contrast, Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide portrays the ruler of the universe as a radical skeptic antirealist and disbeliever in the control of complex systems. Where Levin's novel is a heroic science fiction of rebellion against a technocratic dystopia, Adams's ruler of the universe is located in a little shack on a remote, insignificant planet and, when asked if he rules the universe, he says, “I try not to.” This attitude of relinquishing control for autonomy is more in line with the development of second-order cybernetics and autopoiesis theory. These developments followed classical cybernetics and brought in a constructivist viewpoint that encompassed classical cybernetics as only a special case of systems theory. Where Ira Levin sees humanity making a violent revolution against the all-benevolent but tyrannical central intelligence that rules the length and form of people's lives based on an overall computation of what the system can sustain, Adams makes people complain that there is not a more consistent homeostasis and cybernetic equilibrium in the government of the world.

In the 1980s, building on cybernetic foundations, new theories of dynamical systems - chaos theory with its strange attractors, fractal geometries, and self-similar iterations - and complex adaptive systems (CAS) were developed and introduced. Popularizing some of these developments, Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park - and to a lesser degree the movie made from it - dramatized the consequences of dispensing with cybernetic thinking in the effort to control complex non-linear systems by computers. Reflecting the contrast between classical deterministic science and the new cybernetics of complexity and unpredictability, Jurassic Park also addresses the limits of scientific knowledge and focuses on how the complexity and self-organization paradigms change our views on scientific prediction and control.

Set on an island, Jurassic Park, which exhibits live dinosaurs grown from prehistoric remnants of theirs genes, illustrates the problems bound up with the attempt to gain full control of an ecosystem. Controlled by a huge computer system, the park should be perfectly safe, but little by little, the irregularities and inadequacy of the system are revealed, until its final collapse and catastrophe. It is an extremely powerful renouncement of the deterministic control paradigm: simplicity, linearity, determinism, and control are contrasted with a new realization: nature is non-linear, fractal, and complex. The chaos researcher, Malcolm, plays an important role as the all-knowing reporter of complexity and chaos in this most dramatic setting of wild dinosaurs hunting children. His experience beseeches us to understand that we are at the end of an epoch, and so we had better hurry up and learn some new tricks if we wish to survive. In a later novel, Prey, Crichton imagines what can happen when a self-organizing genetically engineered swarm intelligence is combined with communicating nano-computers. A new, lethal, infectious super-organism emerges, completely out of control, but also competing with an initially benign one that turns out, in the long run, to be much more dangerous. The novel gives a superb illustration of the discrepancy between the current cybernetic knowledge of complexity and self-organization, and the failure of control engineers to grasp the dynamics of chaotic systems.

Within the field of cybernetic anthropology, this tension was especially expressed in Gregory Bateson's Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972). Here Bateson described modern technoscience as a culture of hubris. His major project was to explain the relation of mind and nature - or more precisely, mind in nature from a modern scientific basis, avoiding the metaphysical dualism of Descartes as well as the mechanism of Laplace. Bateson provided a new delimitation of the concept of information: “In fact, what we mean by information - the elementary unit of information - is a difference which makes a difference” (Bateson 1972: 453).

For Bateson, even when that system does not include living organisms, “The elementary cybernetic system with its messages in circuit is, in fact, the simplest unit of mind” (459). Matter and energy are already imbued with informational circular processes of differences. Mind is synonymous with a cybernetic system comprised of a total, self-correcting unit which prepares and processes information. Mind is immanent in this wholeness, because mind is essentially the informational and logical “pattern that connects” through a virtual recursive dynamics of differences in circuit. He sees life and mind as coexisting in an ecological and evolutionary dynamic that integrates the whole biosphere. In sum, Bateson explained mind as a function of complex cybernetic organization, and incorporated his concept of information into a universal cybernetic philosophy. Bateson believed that his version of cybernetics provides an understanding of mind that is neither subjectively idealistic nor mechanically materialistic.

This cybernetic mind also rules our emotions as a relational logic. It shows up in our perception as aesthetics. It is the learning pattern in evolution. Wisdom is to know and live the pattern of evolutionary and ecological wholeness in cultures as well as in individual awareness. The pattern that connects can be understood as a metaphor for what many nature-religious or spiritual types of ecological thinking see as the sacred or the immanent divine. In Bateson a holistic cybernetic science verges on the sacred:

The cybernetic epistemology which I have offered you would suggest a new approach. The individual mind is immanent but not only in the body. It is immanent also in the pathways and messages outside the body; and there is a larger Mind of which the individual mind is only a sub-system. This larger Mind is comparable to God and is perhaps what some people mean by “God,” but it is still immanent in the total interconnected social system and planetary ecology.
(Bateson 1972: 461)
In The Cyberiad Lem places Bateson's vision into literary praxis in “The First Sally, or The Trap of Gargantius.” Trurl and Klapacius land on a planet with two countries planning to wage war against each other; they go to opposite sides of the conflict. Anticipating the consequences of Bateson's theory - that all systems in which bits of information or transforms of difference circulate have cybernetic minds, and the more systems are coupled together the greater the mind will be - Trurl and Klapacius both suggest to the kings and generals on either side to connect their soldiers into closely organized systems by way of a specially constructed armor. When they reach the level of companies, however, the greater mind that is created starts to absorb the soldiers' individual minds:

they took to chatting, and later, through the open windows of the barracks one could hear voices booming in chorus, disputing such matters as absolute truth, analytic versus synthetic a priori propositions, and the Thing-in-itself, for their collective minds had already attained that level.
(Lem 1985: 40)
When they reached the level of battalions, they developed a higher aesthetic sense, and some became sidetracked from warfare into chasing after butterflies: “Among the artillery corps the weightiest metaphysical questions were considered, and, with an absentmindedness characteristic of great genius, these large units lost their weapons, misplaced their equipment and completely forgot that there was a war on” (1985: 41). When the officers attempted to bring the soldiers back to common sense, they too got absorbed in the collective mind or corporate identity and forgot their original mission. “Consciousness, it seemed, formed a deadly trap, in that one could enter it, but never leave” (41).

Finally, on either side totally united, two armies with one mind apiece attack each other, but as soon as they touch are brought into a single system:

There was absolute silence. That famous culmination of consciousness that the great Gargantius had predicted with mathematical precision was now reached on both sides. For beyond a certain point militarism, a purely local phenomenon, becomes civil, and this is because the Cosmos Itself is by nature wholly civilian, and indeed, the minds of both armies had assumed truly cosmic proportions! ... Both armies went off hand in hand, picking flowers beneath the fluffy white clouds, on the field of the battle that never was.

"8. Film and Television, The 1950s (Part I: History)","Accounts of 1950s sf film and television often present it as dominated by alien invasion narratives, in which monsters from outer space seek to subjugate or exterminate humanity. What is more, these narratives are commonly presented as rather simplistic products of Cold War tensions in which the alien is merely a thin disguise for Soviet aggression (see Biskind 1983; Lucanio 1987; Warren 1997). But there are a number of problems with such accounts. For example, as Jancovich (1996) argues, the alien invader was used in a number of different ways and often explicitly articulated anxieties about developments within American society, rather than simply fears of threat from outside. In films such as The Thing from Another World (Nyby 1951) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Siegel 1956), for example, the alien is associated with new forms of rational bureaucratic management at least as much as it is with communist expansionism. The first of these films concerns an isolated group of scientific and military personnel at the North Pole who discover an alien creature frozen in the ice. When the creature thaws out, it becomes clear that it feeds on human blood and can reproduce itself at an alarming rate, a situation that threatens human life on the planet. However, while the Thing is clearly presented as an aggressive threat that sees humanity as little more than food, the film also concerns a tension between the human characters. While the military personnel recognize the nature of the threat, the scientists want to preserve the alien for study, a strategy that proves to be as impractical as it is dangerous.

However, the opposition is presented as one not simply between the army and scientists, but between subordinates and authority. The scientists are presented as major authorities, with high-level Washington contacts, while the military personnel that oppose them are of low rank. As a result, not only are the scientists supported by the military high command - which is presented as inefficient and out of touch - but the scientists value the alien because its lack of emotions is seen as making it “our superior in every way.” The scientists equate the alien's lack of emotions with their ideal of rationality and, like the alien, see ordinary people as being of no value other than to serve their own ends. As the chief scientist puts it, “knowledge is more important than life.” In other words, The Thing from Another World is at least as anxious about the elite of experts that was emerging in postwar America as it was about any external threat from the Soviet Union or outer space.

Furthermore, alien invasion narratives were not simply a product of the Cold War period but had been a key element in the pulp magazines and comic books of the 1930s and 1940s, so much so that by the 1950s writers such as Ray Bradbury were parodying the form in stories such as “The Concrete Mixer” (1949). In other words, different media had very different understandings of sf as a genre and, in sf literature, the alien invader was already regarded as old-fashioned.

If understandings of sf within literature were very different from those in film and television, it is also a mistake to assume that film and television were the same, and there is now a growing body of work that demonstrates that genres work very differently in different media (Creeber 2001; Feuer 1992; Mittel 2004). As a result, the generic categories in operation in one medium are not necessarily operative in the other, and even when both media use the same generic term, it may be understood differently.

Furthermore, it is not simply that film and television are different from one another, but also that American sf films and television programs of the 1950s were fundamentally different from those made in Britain in the same period. Indeed, while most writing on the American context has tended to concentrate on the cinema, which is generally seen as far more creative than television in the period, the case was very different in Britain, where television is often seen as the more creative form.

In the United States, the cycle of sf films was initiated by the success of two space-exploration films, Destination Moon (Pichel 1950) and Rocketship X-M (Neumann 1950), the first of which was a colorful special effects extravaganza, in which a team of American industrial scientists beat the Russians to the Moon, while the second was a low-budget exploitation film, in which explorers land on Mars and encounter the savage remnants of a once advanced civilization that had destroyed itself in nuclear warfare. These two films set the terms for the 1950s fascination with sf exploration but they also revealed one of its problems. While Rocketship X-M is often seen as an inferior film, undermined by a small budget and a reliance on comic-book sensationalism (H.H.T. 1950), it actually achieves much greater narrative interest than Destination Moon, for which the main attraction was its groundbreaking special effects. As a result, producer George Pal, who had made Destination Moon, and became a key figure in 1950s sf and fantasy, recognized that he needed a stronger narrative for his next film of space exploration, When Worlds Collide (Maté 1951). In this film, a group of scientists discover that the Earth is doomed to destruction and rush to build a futuristic Noah's Ark that will transport a specially selected group of men and women to safety on another world. However, it is not only the narrative motivation that is stronger here, but also the personal and political conflicts that afflict the mission, particularly the fascistic schemes of its chief financial backer.

Pal continued his more “realist” approach to sf with a film about an expedition to Mars, Conquest of Space (Haskin 1955), but it proved a financial disaster and effectively put an end to this strand of filmmaking. A more enduring development was the strand which followed Rocketship X-M in featuring more fantastic stories that made little attempt to be “realistic” or “scientifically feasible,” with films such as Cat-Women of the Moon (Hilton 1953), Forbidden Planet (Wilcox 1956), and Queen of Outer Space (Bernds 1958), all featuring explorers who travel to new worlds where they are menaced by the presence or the legacy of its alien civilizations. Similarly films such as Lost Continent (Newfield 1951) and Creature from the Black Lagoon (Arnold 1954) involved earthbound encounters with prehistoric worlds.

However, while Conquest of Space spelled the end of one aspect of the period, the previous year also saw the phenomenal success of Disney's 20,000 Leagues under the Sea (Fleischer 1954), which would start a trend for tales of scientific exploration that were set in the Victorian era and included From the Earth to the Moon (Haskin 1958), Journey to the Center of the Earth (Levin 1959), and even George Pal's The Time Machine (1960).

As we have seen, though, the best remembered sf trend in the 1950s is not about human travel into outer space but rather alien visitations to Earth. While 20,000 Leagues under the Sea demonstrated that a market existed for big-budget, prestige family films, these films were both costly and risky. However, following The Thing from Another World, a cycle of alien invasion movies, which were cheaper to produce, was also underway. While the market became flooded with sf films by the mid- to late 1950s, most of these were not from the major studios but from companies such as American International Pictures and Allied Artists that specialized in low-budget exploitation films.

Furthermore, many of these films were actually referred to in reviews as horror rather than sf, and it is important to acknowledge that they were as much a product of a new cycle of horror production in the late 1950s. Many of these films explicitly blur genre boundaries, for not only were sf films increasingly horror-oriented but there was also a renewed vogue for classic monsters of Gothic horror, which were given “a pseudo-scientific treatment” (Anon. 1957: 117). For example, Jack Arnold, who directed some of the best-loved sf films in the 1950s, including It Came from Outer Space (1953), Creature from the Black Lagoon, and The Incredible ShrinkingMan (1957), also made Monster on the Campus (1959), a “variation on the Jekyll-and-Hyde theme” that was given an sf spin (Anon. 1959: 61).

In the first half of the 1950s, however, the stories of alien visitation were not necessarily horror stories about invading monsters, and many alien visitors were actually saviors of humanity. For example, during the 1940s and 1950s, Superman appeared in comics and films, and on radio and television. Not only was he an alien who protected the Earth from nuclear weapons in Atom Man Versus Superman (Bennet 1950), but Superman and the Mole Men (Sholem 1951), in which Superman defends a benign, subterranean species from “an unthinking, violent mob” of humans, was even seen as “a subtle plea for tolerance” (Gros. 1951: 6).

The best-remembered sympathetic alien is Klaatu in The Day the Earth Stood Still (Wise 1951), a dignified figure who visits Earth to warn us of the dangers of nuclear aggression. However, while many critics have seen this as a positive alternative to the alien invasion movies (e.g., Biskind 1983), it can be interpreted quite differently. If The Thing from Another World displayed anxieties about the new elite of experts, The Day the Earth Stood Still was actually a highly authoritarian film, in which Klaatu's warning is also a threat: humanity is too irresponsible to handle nuclear power, and must surrender itself to a robot police force which will punish aggression with global extinction. If The Thing from Another World saw the rational as potentially repressive and the irrational emotions as the core of human identity, The Day the Earth Stood Still celebrates the rational and presents irrational emotions as simply negative: they are the cause of selfishness, greed, and fear, and must be repressed or transcended.

Alien aggressors also came in a number of other guises, and while some used brute force, others sought more insidious means of colonization. In Invasion of the Body Snatchers, for example, the people of Santa Mira are slowly being replaced by replicas that look and act like those they have replaced, but are really an alien fifth column infiltrating society. Again, however, it is unclear how much these aliens are simply meant to be associated with Soviet aggression, and the film has often been read as an attack on the anti-communist witch-hunts of the period. Furthermore, like The Thing from Another World, the film makes it clear that the authorities are implicated in the process: the aliens seem to replace them first and, even when they have not been replaced, they are incapable of either identifying or combating the problem. Even the process of being transformed from a human being into a blank, unemotional alien is claimed simply to accelerate a process that happens more slowly within American society anyhow.

Not all movie monsters were hostile alien invaders - some were manifestations of humanity's own destructive urges. For example, in Them! (Douglas 1954), nuclear testing in the desert turns insignificant ants into massive monsters that threaten to wipe out humanity, while, in The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (Lourie 1953), a prehistoric monster devastates New York City after nuclear tests awaken it from an icy grave. In other films, the devastating effects of scientific progress were more personal: in The Incredible Shrinking Man, the hero gradually shrinks into nothingness; in The Fly (Neumann 1958), the hero's experiments accidentally fuse his body with that of a housefly.

Finally, when radiation was not causing wildlife to grow to frightening proportions, a number of films featured the grim aftermath of nuclear war. In some, the survivors were menaced by monstrous mutations, while others focused on internal struggles between the survivors. The World, the Flesh and the Devil (MacDougall 1959) even centered on racial tensions, suggesting that racial intolerance may not only have been responsible for humanity's destruction in the first place, but also promises to be a snake in the post-apocalyptic Eden.

American television sf followed a very different path. With the exception of Superman, 1950s feature films avoided comic-book heroes; but television sf was initially dominated by stories that emulated the heroes of comic books and film serials during the 1930s and 1940s. In addition to the long-running The Adventures of Superman (1952-8), for example, Buck Rogers (1950-1), Captain Video and his Video Rangers (1949-55), Flash Gordon (1954-5), Rocky Jones, Space Ranger (1954), and Tom Corbett, Space Cadet (1950-5), among others, battled evil masterminds with sf technology, and found adventure in space. Critics tended to be dismissive of these shows, which were seen as puerile entertainment and little more than crude devices to promote the sponsors' products to children. These shows also attracted other complaints, with Captain Video being cited in the debates around television violence during the period (Hill 1954: 29) and being accused of failing “to integrate sound educational material” into its format (Anon. 1951: 36).

However, television sf began to break out of the confines of children's programming and, as it did so, it sought to validate itself through a series of devices. Science Fiction Theatre (1955-7) claimed that “every story in the series will be based on scientific facts,” while Tales of Tomorrow (1951-3) stressed it would rely on sf literature for its content (Adams 1951: 44, 119). These shows also sought to distinguish themselves by the nature of their format. During the 1950s, the single play had more prestige than the supposedly formulaic serial. As a result, by using the anthology format, shows such as Out There (1951-2), Tales of Tomorrow, and Science Fiction Theatre sought to establish a sense of balance between these two extremes. As weekly shows, rather than single plays, they could build audience loyalty, and by presenting a different story each week they avoided being seen as standardized and low quality.

This cycle of television sf ran from the late 1940s into the mid-1950s, and it is only in 1958 that signs of a new cycle start to emerge in the aftermath of Sputnik, although The New York Times was highly critical of television for its slow response to this event (Gobout 1958: X9). However, by the end of the decade, television sf finally achieved respectability with Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone (1959-64). Serling already had a strong reputation as the writer of several highly regarded single plays, particularly Requiem for a Heavyweight (1956), which often caused a stir with their controversial social commentary. He was well known “for his public protests against what he has described as 'interference of non-artistic people in an artistic medium'” (Shanley 1959: X19), and his decision to co-produce the show was therefore seen as a significant move. As executive producer he had greater control over his scripts, while the show's fantasy format enabled him to handle materials that had proved controversial in his earlier and more “realistic” scripts (see Buhle and Wagner 2003; Sconce 1997). As Serling himself said of his earlier work: “I was not permitted to have Senators discuss any current or pressing problem . . . In retrospect, I probably would have had a much more adult play had I made it science fiction, put it in the year 2057, and peopled the Senate with robots” (qtd in Engelhardt 1998: 153). The show was therefore one of the first instances in which television sf started to be taken seriously, with The New York Times not only identifying Serling as “one of television's abler writers” but also claiming that, in “the desultory field of filmed half-hour drama . . . Serling should not have trouble in making his mark. At least his series promises to be different” (Gould 1959: 39).

Despite this belated respectability, sf films had more prestige in the US during the period than television sf, and many films have acquired classic status since the 1950s. However, in Britain, the situation was significantly different, and it is television sf that is often seen as the more creative medium during the 1950s. Many British sf films were even based on television and radio series, although this is not to claim that there were no significant and well-regarded film projects, particularly in the first half of the decade. The Boulting brothers' Seven Days to Noon (1950), for example, sees a scientist threaten that, “unless atomic bomb production ceases by noon the following Sunday . . . he will, himself, blow up all of London with a bomb he has stolen” (Myro. 1950: 20). In the process, the film deals with the responsibilities of scientists for the impact of their discoveries, a theme also present in The Man in the White Suit (Mackendrick 1951). Although this is a dark comedy, in which a young man invents an indestructible clothing material that never gets dirty, it also charts the shocking implications of this apparently benign discovery, implications that threaten to destroy the fabric of society.

Of the many 1950s British sf films adapted directly from television, the most significant were taken from the first two Quatermass serials. Such adaptations did not simply transfer material from one medium to another, but also involved substantial changes in conceptualization. This was often due to an attempt to negotiate two different audiences. On the one hand, the filmmakers clearly wanted to exploit the established interest in these stories among television audiences and, on the other, they also wanted to extend these pretested materials to new audiences, particularly in the hope of selling films to the American market. Indeed, the bid for the American market often required substantial changes so that, for example, Hollywood stars often had to be cast in leading roles to secure distribution deals in the US. As a result, while the changes were not necessarily “bad,” there were often complaints about these adaptations, most famously from Nigel Kneale, the creator of the Quatermass serials, who complained about the way the Hammer studio “turned my troubled professor into a bawling bully” (Kneale 1979: 6).

The key cinematic innovation of the period was clearly from Hammer, which achieved phenomenal success with The Curse of Frankenstein (Fisher 1957). More than just another sf film, it was a formative influence on later production in Britain, America, and beyond. At one level, it too was a hybrid that combined two key elements of American production in the period to create something new and different. If American productions had modernized the Gothic horror monsters with sf, or reinvented sf by dressing it with Victorian settings and décor, Curse of Frankenstein took the Gothic and placed it back into a period setting. Furthermore, Frankenstein in this film was not a melodramatic mad scientist but a cold, hard rationalist with little concern for the consequences of his actions, and if the film is now remembered largely as a straight horror film, this is partly because its success encouraged Hammer to launch a number of horror series that have obscured its sf credentials.

While sf was still largely associated with pulp magazines and comic books in the US, and was only beginning to break free of its lowbrow image, the BBC was not burdened by such preconceptions due to the well-established European traditions of the literary scientific romance and of science-fictional themes and forms in legitimate theater. These more respectable forms of sf had been employed as early as 1938, when the BBC Television Service had staged a version of Karel Čapek's RUR (Rossum's Universal Robots) (1920), an influential play from which the term “robot” entered cultural consciousness. Similarly, in 1949, the BBC broadcast a version of H.G. Wells's classic, The Time Machine (1895). If these materials were not understood as sf at the time, they would become so later, and would provide a firm basis for those planning to develop television sf.

Another important aspect of these early shows was that they were not aimed predominantly at children, and even when the BBC began to produce sf for children in the 1950s, it was markedly different from that produced in the US. For example, Stranger from Space (1951-3) was not only developed with a strong educational agenda, but it also refused to limit its didactic aspects to the presentation of information. On the contrary, the show revolved around a series of serious moral problems and dilemmas as its young hero encounters alien life. The Lost Planet (1954) and Return to the Lost Planet (1955) were somewhat nearer to the comic-book adventures produced in the US, but they were adaptations of already-successful radio series transferred to television in the period immediately preceding the introduction of the first rival to the BBC monopoly, the new commercial Independent Television (ITV). In other words, they were produced at precisely the point at which the BBC was becoming aware that it could no longer be complacent about audiences but needed to produce more popular programming to compete for a viewing public.

Much the same was also true of the most important sf program of the decade, The Quatermass Experiment (1953). Indeed, it is often discussed as a television event whose importance in Britain during the period was second only to that of the live broadcast of Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation (see Barr 1986). Furthermore, although it was billed not as an sf story, but as a “thriller,” the program is now firmly established within the canon of television sf. The story concerns an astronaut who returns to earth infected by an alien lifeform, and who gradually metamorphoses into a monster that threatens to absorb all life on the earth.

As should be clear from Kneale's description of his protagonist, Bernard Quatermass, as a “troubled professor,” the serial was as much about its scientist's sense of guilt and responsibility as about the agony of its victim or the threat to the Earth. Kneale had already explored similar issues in an earlier play, Number Three (1953), and they would be central to his later work, including his 1954 adaptation of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and his examination of the tensions between science and exploitation in The Creature (1955).

If Nineteen Eighty-Four transferred these questions to the context of a totalitarian dystopia, both Quatermass II (1955) and Quatermass and the Pit (1958) would continue these themes while suggesting that the roots of a totalitarian future were already firmly established in Britain. In Quatermass II, the country is governed by a cold bureaucracy that conceals an alien invasion, and even those who have not been mentally and physically contaminated by the alien species have surrendered their liberty for high wages. In Quatermass and the Pit, human intelligence is revealed to be the product of alien experimentation by a dying Martian race in the prehistoric past, and it is this biological engineering that is claimed to be responsible for the racial intolerance that motivates many human conflicts today. The serial also concerns Quatermass's attempt to resist the acquisition of his space research by the military, and the two strands of this plot come together in his final impassioned plea to camera: “Every war crisis, witch-hunt, race riot, and purge is a reminder and a warning . . . We are the Martians now. If we cannot control the inheritance within us, this will be their second dead planet.”

The troubled scientist was also a feature of television programs such as The Burning Glass (1956) and I Can Destroy the Sun (1958). Anti-nuclear campaigner J.B. Priestley also wrote Doomsday for Dyson (1958), in which an ordinary man is held responsible for the nuclear destruction of the planet on the grounds that it is the apathy and complacency of people like himself that permits the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Both Underground (1958) and The Offshore Island (1959) featured grim stories of Britain in the aftermath of nuclear war.

Certainly, it could be argued that, after the introduction of commercial television in 1955, the majority of sf programming was developed by the new ITV with a populist agenda. However, alongside shows such as The Invisible Man (1958-9), which emulated the American adventure series and was clearly designed to be sold to the US, several of the challenging and controversial shows mentioned above were produced by ITV as part of its prestigious and influential Armchair Theatre (1956-68).

While the above discussion has provided an account of those American and British films and television programs that are often identified as examples of sf today, it is necessary to remember that generic terms do not simply describe a coherent and unitary body of texts; rather, generic definitions are bound up with complex social processes of classification that are subject to intense debate and conflict (see Jancovich 2000; Mittel 2004; Naremore 1998; Neale 2000). It is not simply that the boundaries of sf as a generic category were continually being contested during the period, but that these conflicts were due to fundamentally different conceptions of what the genre was and how it operated; and that they persist. Even today, when 1950s film and television sf is increasingly available in all its diversity and complexity, it is still often remembered as being simply concerned with alien invasions. Our account is not merely a corrective to that perception, but part of an ongoing, contingent, and irresolvable debate about the nature of the genre.",,2137954306,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Jancovich, Mark and Johnston"," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

"9. Fiction, 1950-1963 (Part I: History)","A case can be made that the 1950s were the most consequential decade in the history of sf. The pulp magazines, whose ragged pages and gaudy covers had defined the genre for over two decades, were gone by 1958, supplanted by digest publications whose trimmer, less seedy appearance indicated an appeal to a more adult readership. The magazine culture itself was steadily giving ground to a burgeoning book market, from specialty presses run by sf fans to major lines at mainstream houses. Newer writers like John Wyndham and Ray Bradbury were soon household names, and works originally published in genre magazines (e.g., Walter M. Miller Jr's A Canticle for Leibowitz (1959)) became bestsellers when released in book form. Sf was thriving not only in film and television, but also in general-circulation periodicals, reaching a broad postwar audience primed to receive its vision of a world transformed by powerful new technologies. Ideas and inventions long championed within the field - space exploration, atomic energy - were imminent realities, which contemporary sf treated with growing sophistication as pulp styles of writing gave way to more polished and even experimental techniques. By the close of the decade, sf stood poised to achieve a cultural visibility, commercial success, and literary acclaim of which the pulp era could only have dreamed.

Yet, despite this great promise, the 1950s ended with setbacks that made many anxious about the genre's future. The US magazine market, long subject to boom and bust cycles, came perilously close to collapse, declining from a total of 23 titles in the summer of 1957 to only six by the end of 1960. As a result, numerous authors were either driven out of the field or forced to expand their output into other forms of writing. The early 1960s was a fallow period during which the genre, rather than consolidating its gains, lost markets and shed talent. With a few notable exceptions, sf writers seemed content to reprocess established themes and storylines that had grown stale with use. It was only with the advent of the “New Wave” later in the decade that the vast potential of the 1950s came to be fully realized.

Prose and pros: an evolving marketplace

John Campbell's Astounding (1930-), the dominant venue for serious sf during the previous decade, began to acquire competition in the form of ambitious new magazines that challenged not just its market share but its very vision of the genre. The two most important were The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (F&SF, 1949-) and Galaxy (1950-80, 1994-15). A stylish and erudite publication, F&SF took a catholic view of the field, mixing sf with fantasy and horror, and reprinting classic stories by Lord Dunsany and Robert Louis Stevenson alongside innovative work by younger writers such as Alfred Bester, Richard Matheson, and Philip K. Dick. The goal of the co-editors, J. Francis McComas and Anthony Boucher, was to publish “intelligent adult” sf, eschewing the “routine gadget-type story . . . or the Interplanetary Horse Opera” that prevailed in the pulps, while exploring the hazy “borderline between science-fiction . . . and fantasy” that Campbell's Astounding, committed to a purer hard-sf aesthetic, tended to avoid (McComas 1982: 12-13). Horace L. Gold, editor of Galaxy, was equally determined to strike out in fresh directions, shunning “the old pulp kind of interplanetary shoot-em-up” (Rosheim 1986: 10) in favor of sharply satirical, character-driven tales of dystopian near futures. Celebrated novels such as Bester's The Demolished Man (1953) and Frederik Pohl and C.M. Kornbluth's The Space Merchants (1953) appeared first as serials in Galaxy's pages in 1952.

With F&SF and Galaxy soon joining Astounding as top-tier journals, a host of new titles arose in their wake. Some, such as Fantastic (1952-80) and If (1952-74, 1986), were destined for long-term success, while others (e.g., Imagination (1950-8), Fantastic Universe (1953-60)) did not outlast the decade. Sf pulps, many of which had been around since the 1930s (e.g., Planet Stories (1939-55), Thrilling Wonder Stories (1929-55)), were shouldered aside, either forced, like Amazing Stories in 1953, to convert to a digest format or else perishing in one of the routine culls the market suffered. Boom years included 1957 and especially 1953, when a record 181 issues of 38 different sf titles were published in the US and Britain; the mid- and late 1950s, by contrast, were shakeout phases in which assorted problems - rising production costs, the bankruptcy of a major distributor - conspired to wipe out marginal publications. The collapse at the end of the decade was particularly severe: “Fourteen magazines vanished within little more than 28 months” (Ashley 2005: 188), and the six survivors were far from financially secure. Many of the fatalities were “ripe for obliteration, put together in a hurry by people who knew nothing of science fiction, printing derivative yard goods and living off the reputations of their better brethren. But some of the good ones fell, too” (Pohl 1978: 216-17).

In contrast to this unnerving pattern of expansion and contraction, the sf book market displayed an impressively steady growth. During the late 1940s, a handful of prominent fans realized that over the years the genre had produced a sizeable backlog of stories, and developed a sufficient readership, to sustain presses dedicated to reprinting the best of this material in book form. Small publishing houses like Gnome and Shasta brought the work of authors who had made names for themselves in the pulps to a new generation of readers, their enterprising example eventually luring mainstream firms into the field. The first professional publisher to launch a hardcover sf line was Doubleday in 1950, its early releases including such classics as Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles (1950) and Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters (1951). Paperback houses such as Bantam, Ballantine, and Ace soon followed suit, flooding the market with fiction initially featured in the magazines but also, increasingly, with original work written expressly for book publication. In Britain, there was a similar mushrooming of sf lists among established presses like Weidenfeld and Nicholson and Michael Joseph, the latter making a small fortune from Wyndham's popular catastrophe stories (e.g., The Day of the Triffids (1951)).

The rise of a book market impacted the field in a number of important ways. The 1950s was the first decade during which the masterpieces of sf literature, which had appeared over time in ephemeral journals, were simultaneously available in durable editions, giving readers access not only to current work but also to the cream of the pulp archive. The range of formal techniques available to writers also expanded since a freestanding book was, at least potentially, a more aesthetically autonomous work than a novel or story cycle written with the exigencies of serialization in mind. Some authors, in collecting magazine stories, stitched them together with newly written passages into “fix-up” novels (e.g., Isaac Asimov's I, Robot (1950)) that, while still episodic, possessed a fresh structural coherence.

Above all, rather than catering to magazine editors who often demanded a specific ideological or stylistic slant (and who would sometimes, as in the case of Gold at Galaxy, revise submissions without consultation in order to achieve them), authors could begin to imagine themselves as independent professionals with their own unique artistic visions. Heinlein, for instance, grew so frustrated with editorial meddling (Heinlein 1989: 6, 163) that he began to write more or less exclusively for mainstream book publishers like Doubleday, Scribner's, and especially Putnam, for whom Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) was a surprise bestseller. During the boom years of the 1950s, it was actually possible for the first time to make a living as an sf writer; as Barry N. Malzberg has calculated, an average output of 1,000 words per day would produce an annual income of around $6,000 (nearly twice the national median), although, as he acknowledges, the disintegration of the magazine market at the end of the decade eroded these gains considerably (Malzberg 1982: 39-46).

One offshoot of sf's increasing professionalization was the 1956 founding of the Milford Writers' Conference, an annual workshop co-sponsored by James Blish, Judith Merril, and Damon Knight. At these gatherings, which brought together established authors and aspiring novices, unpublished manuscripts were exchanged and assessed, tactics for dealing with pesky editors hammered out, and the benefits and drawbacks of specific markets debated. An outgrowth of the first conference was Science Fiction Forum, a short-lived publication edited by Knight and Lester del Rey, designed to maintain the supportive shoptalk cultivated at Milford. Starting in 1959, a newsletter edited by Theodore R. Cogswell, Proceedings for the Institute of Twenty-First Century Studies, built on this foundation, providing a venue for wide-ranging and sometimes testy conversations regarding the exigencies of the sf marketplace. Complaints about tin-eared or intrusive editors were front and center; there was even consideration of a strike for higher word rates. The camaraderie fostered at Milford and in these published forums laid the groundwork for a writers' union, the Science Fiction Writers of America, which Knight would eventually found in 1965.

This movement toward professional status was not without its critics. Some authors who had entered sf via fandom worried that crucial links might be lost with this network of nonprofessionals, who could feel excluded from the presumed elite. The influence of fan culture has always been more pronounced within sf than other popular genres, and during the 1950s, as major meetings such as the World Science Fiction Convention grew in size and complexity, longtime fans began complaining about the “creeping professionalism” (Warner and Lynch 1992: 336) that was turning their close-knit, casual gatherings into a regimented assembly of self-interested cliques. Another concern was the literary pretension of the Milford crowd, their claim that authorial autonomy was essential if one were to be, in Merril's words, “an artist rather than an artisan” (qtd in Cogswell 1992: 48). The various writers' conferences and newsletters of the period were designed to promote not only higher occupational standards, but also a sense of sf as serious literature, a posture that drew grumblings from authors with a less exalted view of their craft. As del Rey observes, some became so disaffected with the emerging “consensus of taste” that they began to speak of a “Milford Mafia” whose growing influence was potentially pernicious (del Rey 1979: 223). These sorts of divisions would only become more pointed during the 1960s, providing fodder for the ferocious debates surrounding the “New Wave” movement.

Raising the bar: sf and/as literature

While the New Wave is generally seen as the moment when sf decisively shed its pulp heritage and began to adopt the aesthetic modalities of “mainstream” literature, this trend was actually set in motion during the 1950s. Indeed, Campbell's Astounding had, in the 1940s, already begun to curtail the worst excesses of pulp super-science in favor of more disciplined extrapolation rendered in cleaner, less breathlessly purple prose. Yet what counted most for Campbell was not aesthetic ambition or stylistic flair, but scientific accuracy (three of his chief contributors - Asimov, Heinlein, and L. Sprague de Camp - had trained as scientists and engineers). The most self-consciously literary, humanistically inclined author in Campbell's stable, Theodore Sturgeon, had so many run-ins with the intransigent editor that, once the new markets opened after 1950, he published only one story in Astounding during the subsequent decade, compared with scores in other magazines. Campbell had proven that a serious-minded alternative to pulp plots and styles could prosper in the genre, and the new digests of the 1950s, especially Galaxy and F&SF, set out to show that the field could now accommodate ironic satire, allusive wordplay, and ambitious character studies - in short, the kinds of writing that prevailed in the literary mainstream. Their success was an inspiration to those who had faith in sf's potential as a significant art form.

These true believers included the three founders of the Milford Conference, whose multifarious efforts throughout the decade - less as writers than as editors, critics, and propagandists - laid the groundwork for a vindication of sf as art that younger writers would embrace in the 1960s. Merril, who would herself emerge as a vigorous advocate of New Wave sf, kicked off, in 1956, a series of “year's best” anthologies that gathered work not only by genre authors but also by literary luminaries ranging from John Steinbeck to Eugène Ionesco. She justified this eclecticism in editorial summations that argued for a more expansive definition of sf as “science fantasy” or “speculative fiction”: “fables of our time” that deploy “the frivolities of space-ships and . . . robots” in order to “add emotional urgency and dramatic power to what are basically problems in philosophy and morality” (Merril 1956: 10). In the seventh annual volume, Merril declared that the “specialized cult of science fiction” was in the process of disappearing, as its “essential quality is absorbed into the main body of literature” (Merril 1963: 391) - a bold claim seemingly proven by the series' publication history: debuting with a specialty press, Gnome, it was soon picked up by a prestigious house, Simon and Schuster, running until 1967.

Blish and Knight made abortive attempts to pilot new magazines into the turbulent market (Vanguard (1958) and Worlds Beyond (1950-1), respectively), but these managed a total of only four issues. Their more lasting contribution to sf's new literary consciousness was their critical writing for a range of professional and fan magazines. Blish's pieces, printed under the pseudonym William Atheling Jr, were, like Merril's summations, geared to spur sf into the broader mainstream; his first essay, published in 1952, argued that this leap could only be achieved if the genre embraced standards of writing that included not simply “technical competence,” but “[f]reshness of idea, acuity of observation, [and] depth of emotional penetration” (Blish 1973: 7). Failing this, sf could never hope to transcend “the little ghettos reserved for us in the Sunday book sections of daily newspapers” (Blish 1973:17). Knight's reviews - appearing in a number of journals over the course of the decade, under the general title “The Dissecting Table” - were similarly uncompromising in their demand that sf adhere to elevated norms of writing in order to become “a field of literature worth taking seriously” (Knight 1967: 1). What is aesthetically pleasing in the best sf, he claimed, “is not different from the thing that makes mainstream stories rewarding, but only expressed differently . . . not in small, everyday symbols, but in the big ones of space and time” (Knight 1967: 4). Both he and Blish could be scathing if specific authors or texts failed to live up to this ideal; the reputation of Golden Age titan A.E. van Vogt suffered a crippling blow when Knight lambasted him as a “Cosmic Jerrybuilder” (Knight 1967: 47-62).

Knight's trail-blazing reviews were gathered in book form as In Search of Wonder (1956) and Blish's criticism as The Issue at Hand (1964), both published by Advent, a small firm in Chicago that was, essentially, the first scholarly imprint in the field. (Fantasy Press, another fan-based enterprise, had released the first anthology of critical writing about the genre, Arthur Eshbach's Of Worlds Beyond (1947), in which Heinlein pioneered the term “speculative fiction” as an alternative connotation for sf.) Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, Advent published a raft of nonfiction titles - critical studies, memoirs, bibliographies, encyclopedias - that helped generate a sense of the field as a cohesive topic of inquiry with its own hallowed history and textual canon. Their 1969 collection, The Science Fiction Novel: imagination and social criticism, edited by Basil Davenport, featured four substantial essays on the art of sf by Heinlein, Bester, Kornbluth, and Robert Bloch, with Kornbluth's “The Failure of the Science Fiction Novel as Social Criticism” unapologetically making use of “the methods of modern literary criticism” to address his subject (Davenport 1969: 49). Soon, mainstream authors were turning gazes of critical approbation toward the genre: British novelist Kingsley Amis's New Maps of Hell (1960), based on a series of lectures given the previous year at Princeton University, warmly defended sf against charges of escapism, celebrating it as a satirical “medium in which our society can criticize itself” (Amis 1960: 134). Meanwhile, sf was making its way into the classroom as a legitimate object of study, with Sam Moskowitz's 1953 course at New York City College leading the way, and talks by sf authors were becoming regular fixtures on college campuses (the essays in Davenport's volume being the fruits of a 1957 symposium at the University of Chicago).

Sf was also reaching a broader audience via general-circulation magazines, ranging from old stalwarts like Collier's (1888-1957) to upstart titles such as Playboy (1953-). The latter, whose fiction editor during the mid- to late 1950s was fantasy author Ray Russell, published stories by Arthur C. Clarke, Charles Beaumont, Robert Sheckley, Fredric Brown, and numerous other sf authors, paying rates that beggared the penniesper-word of the genre magazines. In this colonization of prestigious venues, Heinlein was, as in so many areas, the pioneer, having placed his story of the capitalist conquest of space, “The Man Who Sold the Moon,” with The Saturday Evening Post (1921-69) in 1947, thus paving the way for Ray Bradbury, who not only found a comfortable home in that journal during the early 1950s, but also set up shop in other mainstream outlets like Esquire (1933-) and McCall's (1897-2002). The venerable Collier's had long been a welcoming venue for fantasy, having featured Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories in the 1930s, but in the 1950s its remit expanded to include sf, running several early tales by Kurt Vonnegut and serializing Jack Finney's classic novel of alien invasion, The Body Snatchers, in 1954. Vonnegut's crossover success during this period was proof of sf's growing acceptance: while his second and third novels, The Sirens of Titan (1959) and Mother Night (1962), were released as paperback originals, they were so well reviewed and sold so strongly that his next book, Cat's Cradle (1963), was brought out by a major hardcover house, Holt, Rinehart, and Winston. A triumphant career such as Vonnegut's simply would not have been possible for a US writer treating sf themes at any time prior to the 1950s.

Dystopia and apocalypse: sf in the postwar world

What accounts for this rising popularity and cultural visibility of sf? Most obviously, the technological revolution that accompanied the Second World War in a host of inventions, from atomic bombs to television, whose existence had been foreseen in 1920s and 1930s pulps. The accelerated tempo of scientific development in the postwar period, with all manner of new devices conspiring to transform or threaten people's lives, made sf seem not only prescient but uniquely relevant, since one of the genre's key themes has always been the inescapable reality of technosocial change. While sf in the mass media was more broadly popular than print sf (indeed, the 1950s were a boom period for sf film), the fact that the market could sustain, during its peak years, dozens of magazines and paperback lines, indicated that the field was growing not just as a specialized market but as a general consumer taste. The escalation of the US space program following the 1957 launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik only increased sf's crossover appeal, priming the market for the bestsellers that would emerge from the genre during the 1960s. By this point, iconography whose appeal had been largely confined to a genre readership for over three decades - from rocket ships to rayguns, aliens to robots - pervaded British and American popular culture.

Two well-received novels by mainstream authors published on the cusp of the 1950s, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and George R. Stewart's Earth Abides (1949), had shown how open a general audience could be to seriously purposed sf. Moreover, the specific scenarios treated in these texts - near-future dystopia and global apocalypse, respectively - were to become the genre's two most prevalent themes during the coming decade. The latter should not be surprising given that the USSR had tested its first atomic device in August 1949, leading to widespread anxieties about superpower competition and the imminent likelihood of global destruction. While the catastrophe depicted in Stewart's novel was precipitated by plague, the genre was soon generating, as Paul Brians (1987: 353-7) exhaustively shows, waves of stories dealing with nuclear holocaust specifically, with the decade bookended by Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, where civilization begins afresh on Mars following the extinction of life on Earth, and Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz, where a post-holocaust society rediscovers the secrets of atomic power and commences a fresh cycle of annihilation. Both books sold quite well, as did mainstream versions of the theme, such as Nevil Shute's On the Beach (1957) and Pat Frank's Alas, Babylon (1959), suggesting that sf held a substantial crossover appeal for readers seeking visionary treatments of the major looming terror in their lives. As Paul Boyer comments, “the status of the genre rose” during the atomic age, when its pulp fantasies became everyday realities; “for all its exotic trappings, science fiction is best understood as a commentary on contemporary issues” (Boyer 1985: 257-8), as a growing popular audience appreciated.

Indeed, postwar sf was more inclined to tackle topical, even politically controversial, issues than previous work in the field had been. While tales of disaster were always a staple of the genre, British and American authors now took up not only the risks of atomic devastation, but other man-made perils such as ecological catastrophe (John Christopher's The Death of Grass (1956)), industrial pollution (Kornbluth's “Shark Ship” (1958)), and overpopulation (J.G. Ballard's “Billenium” (1961)). Hot-button topics addressed during the period included runaway consumerism (Pohl and Kornbluth's The Space Merchants, Fritz Leiber's “A Bad Day for Sales” (1953)), suburban conformity (Sheckley's “Cost of Living” (1952)), the dangers of McCarthyism (Asimov's “The Martian Way” (1952)), the brutal policing of dissent (Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (1953)), and the homogenizing effects of modern mass media (Vonnegut's “Harrison Bergeron” (1961)). Much of this work was published in Galaxy, which specialized in hard-edged, satirical dystopias that were thinly veiled commentaries on the contemporary scene, as critics at the time perceived. In New Maps of Hell, Amis coined the term “comic inferno” to describe stories, especially by Sheckley and Pohl, that playfully proliferated technological novelties while maintaining a ruthlessly sardonic “connection with observable features of our own society” (Amis 1960: 104). Kornbluth's attack on the genre's perennial failure as social criticism indicates how important the political dimension of the field was to 1950s writers, with sf “among the very few mass markets where, sufficiently masked, an antiauthoritarian statement could be published” (Malzberg 1982: 34). The aggressive political consciousness of the 1960s New Wave was simply a more militant recrudescence of this 1950s strain of satirical critique.

Similarly, 1950s sf prefigured the New Wave's heightened attention to issues of gender and sexuality, topics the genre had always tended to treat with elliptical discretion if not to skirt outright. The explosion of magazine markets, and the consequent pressure for material to fill them, made editors less cautious in their choices than they might otherwise have been: Philip José Farmer's debut story, “The Lovers” (1952), a path-breaking tale of human-alien miscegenation, appeared in a struggling pulp (Startling Stories (1939-55)) that was desperate for new readers, as did his creepy Freudian 1953 follow-up, “Mother” (Thrilling Wonder Stories). Throughout the decade, Sturgeon specialized in bold explorations of formerly taboo subjects, ranging from multiple-partner relationships (“The Sex Opposite” (1952)) to homosexuality (“The World Well Lost” (1953)) to utopian gender-blending (Venus Plus X (1960)). The more open climate for such material may in part have been due to the growing diversity of sf authorship: whereas the number of women writers in the genre prior to 1950 did not exceed a small handful (with most of these, such as C.L. Moore and Leigh Brackett, publishing under ambiguous bylines), the subsequent decade saw the flowering of unapologetically female-authored, if not exactly feminist, sf, with Merril, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Mildred Clingerman, Miriam Allen de Ford, Zenna Henderson, Margaret St Clair, Katherine MacLean, and Kate Wilhelm enjoying thriving careers. Merril's Shadow on the Hearth (1950) showed what a female viewpoint could bring to the genre, tackling the theme of atomic conflict from the perspective of a suburban housewife struggling to cope with the burgeoning crisis.

By the early 1960s, sf had a broader-based appeal and an ampler thematic repertoire than ever before. The conviction that it was steadily becoming a more sophisticated form of literature was widespread, and not just among the Milford crowd. The demise of the pulps closed an era of interplanetary adventures geared largely toward young adults, making way for a more mature and cosmopolitan kind of fiction. Several classic novels of the period capture a sense of evolving maturity not only in their themes but also in their titles - Sturgeon's More Than Human (1953), Clarke's Childhood's End (1953). In its attention to character as well as concept, to stylistic panache as well as scientific precision, 1950s sf achieved historically unprecedented levels of literary success and critical acclaim.

Collapse and renewal: on the eve of the New Wave

And then the bottom fell out. Malzberg claims that the epic die-off of magazine titles at the end of the decade proves that “overextension inevitably hit the wall imposed by a readership which would not expand” (Malzberg 1982: 41); yet it is worthwhile to remember that, even amid the seismic contraction that afflicted the genre from 1958 to 1962, novels like A Canticle for Leibowitz and Stranger in a Strange Land were still selling tens of thousands of copies. The transition from a specialized (sub) culture centered on periodicals to a more general market oriented around hardcover and paperback books could not occur without some growing pains, although this is not to downplay the heartbreaking price paid by many writers and fans who lived through the resultant fallout. This price was evident in the host of authors who fled the field during these troubled years (Bester, Miller, Sturgeon, Algis J. Budrys, Ward Moore, Robert Silverberg, William Tenn), their places taken by competent but largely second-rank talents (e.g., Lloyd Biggle Jr, Keith Laumer, Fred Saberhagen) who, rather than continuing the trend of innovation, seemed content to retread familiar ground. What is unquestionable is that the genre failed, at the dawn of the 1960s, to capitalize on the favorable position it had attained during the previous decade, leading many to echo the plaintive query of Earl Kemp's 1961 Hugo-winning fanzine, Who Killed Science Fiction?

Yet heralds of sf's death were premature, since the forces that would revitalize the genre in the coming years had already taken root. While the magazines languished, the book market grew, gradually nurturing a generation of authors whose work would define the new decade. The program of aesthetic ambition and steady professionalism spawned by the Milford Conferences continued to supply an agenda for writers eager to push themselves creatively, to transcend prevailing orthodoxies. And Merril's “year's best” anthologies, in addition to showing that excellent work was still being done even amid the current doldrums, kept up the editor's calls for a newly relevant speculative fiction that would radically transform the field. These institutional structures provided the scaffolding for the New Wave that would emerge, first in Britain and then the US, during the mid-1960s. When J.G. Ballard rhetorically inquired, in a 1962 guest editorial in the British magazine New Worlds, “Which Way to Inner Space?,” there were some, at least, who were prepared to give an answer.",,2137960058,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Latham, Rob"," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

Black Theatre and Performance Studies: Seminal Critical Essays and Articles,"The negro playwright and the racial mountain: Black performance in the era of the Harlem Renaissance
The struggle to define the purpose and content of black art raged on into the 1920s and came to characterize the complex and sophisticated intellectual debates forming around African American culture for much of the modern era. In many ways, the conflict between propaganda and aesthetics that black women playwrights faced in writing anti-lynching dramas presaged the public debate about black art that dominated the Harlem Renaissance era of the 1920s. This historically fecund period of African American culture and modernity nurtured a full flourishing of jazz, blues, and literary culture, and the celebration of what was also referred to as a “New Negro era” for African Americans. Centered in Harlem, a neighborhood which served as a home to thousands of black migrants who had fled the southern horrors of mob violence and economic desolation, the movement provided a cultural outlet for African Americans to respond to their new urban surroundings. Moreover, intellectual leaders, such as W. E. B. Du Bois, championed this prolific activity in the arts as a crucial component in the struggle for black empowerment (Du Bois, 1916). For these figures, the arts operated not only as an expressive medium, but they served as a site of representational revision for a people haunted by minstrel caricature.

The genre of the pageant production—a combination of lavish costuming, dance, music, tableaux, and historical narrative—marked the increasing use of theatre as an outlet to mark the “re-birth” of the black image in US culture. Productions such as The Great Cuba Pageant of 1898 explored the Afro-Cuban revolution, and The Milestones of the Race featured little dialogue and instead focused on mounting visually stunning scenes of black social and historical progress. In 1915, Du Bois himself organized perhaps the best known pageant of the era, The Star of Ethiopia (Du Bois, 1913/1996), an event designed to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Civil War. With a cast and crew of 350, Du Bois’s ambitious pageant extended the vision of his landmark The Souls of Black Folk (Du Bois, 1903) in theatrical terms. By mounting a series of “episodes” documenting the various “gifts of the race to the world” (e.g., the Gift of Civilization, the Gift of the Struggle Toward Freedom, the Gift of Freedom), The Star of Ethiopia sought to fuse the lavish visual aesthetics born out of black musical theatre with pointed social and political propaganda that might revise and reinvent popular images of African Americans in the twentieth century.

Fueled in part by Du Bois’s efforts, the debate over aesthetic representations of African Americans unfurled in major publications of the period, most notably between Langston Hughes in his landmark article “The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain” (Hughes, 1926) and iconoclastic novelist and journalist George Schuyler in his sardonic essay “The Negro-Art Hokum” Schuyler, 1926). While Hughes called for black writers to use art as a space to celebrate the specificity of southern culture and a kind of idealized, African cultural aesthetics, Schuyler mocked the notion of promoting a culturally distinct black art. Against this backdrop of debate, black theatre continued to evolve—in regional theatre companies and in schools and churches—along the TOBA, where entertainers experimented with musical and vaudeville genres, and on Broadway, where black musicals reached a pinnacle of success during the Jazz Age.

A cluster of Harlem intellectuals came together during this period to organize the Little Theatre movement as a way to push forward the social and political efficacy of black drama. Inspired by a similar undertaking led by Yeats and others in Ireland, the black Little Theatre movement dedicated itself to the celebration of Negro “folk culture” and what some would later argue was a romanticization of southern black “peasant” culture. From their vantage point in the hurly-burly bustle of the urban North, Little Theatre activists, such as Du Bois, Alain Locke, Jessie Redmon Fauset, James Weldon Johnson, and others viewed rural black culture as a rare, fragile, and evanescent culture, untouched by urban growth and threatened by modernity. Playwrights such as Willis Richardson, in his 1923 one-act play The Chip Woman’s Fortune (Richardson, 1923/1928) (the tale of a woman selling firewood to survive, and the first black drama produced on Broadway), embodied the spirit of the movement. Richardson’s plays subsequently met with a mixture of approval from folk-drama advocates and disdain from the likes of Howard University president J. Stanley Durkee, who banned Richardson’s works from student productions because of what he viewed as their shameful endorsement of black dialect.

Even within the Little Theatre movement, activists and artists differed in their political agendas. Locke and Du Bois famously clashed over defining the utility of black theatre, with each scholar writing several high-profile essays on the subject. While Locke held fast to prioritizing the advancement of sophisticated aesthetics in black drama, Du Bois used his role as the leading black intellectual activist of the period to argue that theatre must, first and foremost, serve as a mouthpiece for addressing racial issues and advancing the causes of African Americans. Towards this end, the Du Bois-edited Crisis magazine and the Urban League’s journal Opportunity (edited by Charles S. Johnson) each sponsored influential literary contests with cash awards to encourage African American writers. From “1925 to 1927 the contests awarded fifteen playwrights thirty prizes ranging from $10 to $200” (Hatch and Shine, 1974, p. 218), encouraging the emergence of several key new literary voices—including Zora Neale Hurston, who won the Opportunity contest in 1925 for Color Struck (Hurston, 1925/1996), a one-act play about colorism and racial discrimination within the black community, and in 1926 for The First One (Hurston, 1926/1996), a re-examination of the biblical curse-of-Ham narrative.

Hurston was just one of several African American women who met with great success in the theatre of this period. Indeed, although Du Bois and Locke attracted press attention as black intellectual luminaries dedicated to nurturing and developing black drama, it was the women—many of whom were schoolteachers and leaders in their churches and lodges—who looked to theatre as a space to voice their opinions on everything from voting rights and birth control to urban poverty and the roles of mothers in black communities. Du Bois’s Crisis journal and his Crisis Guild of Writers and Actors’ (KRIGWA) Little Negro Theatre, established in 1926, for instance, provided a creative (and yet short-lived) home for writers such as Eulalie Spence, author of fourteen plays, and Marita Bonner, the ground-breaking experimental playwright who, in works such as The Purple Flower (Bonner, 1928/1996), utilized surreal dreamscapes to articulate her own interiority. While Spence eventually evolved into an outspoken opponent of Du Bois’s stringent art and propaganda policies, Bonner worked throughout her career to straddle both realms.

Just as KRIGWA and other organizations looked inwards towards developing black drama aesthetics, pioneering actors such as Charles Gilpin, Wayland Rudd, and Paul Robeson each starred in versions of Eugene O’Neill’s The Emperor Jones (O’Neill, 1921) and broke new ground, achieving success as serious dramatic thespians who received accolades in the world of mainstream theatre. The Harlem Renaissance thus fostered active bi-lateral movement among black actors, entertainers, and playwrights as they continued to work towards achieving creative autonomy and political voice in dramas developed within the community, while simultaneously gaining visibility and acceptance in dominant cultural venues. Iconoclasts, such as satirist Wallace Thurman, brought their voices to the world of black theatre as well, marking a shift in the tone of drama produced during the Renaissance. In his controversial 1929 play Harlem (Thurman, 1929/2003), Thurman created a gritty, sobering portrait of the neighborhood celebrated and idealized by fellow contemporary writers. This Harlem was a miasma of sex, violence, and crime—an amoral dystopia that provided little relief for its southern migrant protagonists. While white audiences and critics lauded Thurman’s effort, the play received a cold shoulder from black critics (who were, ironically, denied press passes for its debut at the Apollo Theatre).

Jazz and blues musical performances flourished in both segregated white spaces such as the Cotton Club and the legendary Apollo Theatre, which shifted to a predominantly black clientele as the 1930s wore on. Such venues introduced an impressive array of world-renown talent—from Sarah Vaughan and Pearl Bailey to Ella Fitzgerald. Yet no production manifested the energy, ebullience, and rapidly evolving mainstream popularity of jazz culture more than Shuffle Along (1921), a musical that ran for over 504 performances and launched the careers of such entertainers as Josephine Baker, Paul Robeson, Florence Mills, and Adelaide Hall, among many others. Based on an old vaudeville sketch, Shuffle Along was initially staged by the Pekin Stock Company in Chicago without music. Its move to Broadway was accompanied by what would become Eubie Blake’s smash—hit compositions (“I’m Craving for That Kind of Love” and “I’m Just Wild about Harry”). Other productions scrambled to match the chorus-line spectacle and musical grandeur of Shuffle Along, leading to several copycat shows throughout the 1920s, such as Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake’s own Chocolate Dandies (1924) and white producer Lew Leslie’s reactionary throwback, Dixie to Broadway (1924). Ironically, then, Shuffle Along, with its nod towards the urban sophistication, speed, and grandeur of modern Harlem, might be regarded as the beginning of the crucial break from the stigma of one-note, minstrel shuffling that black performers had been striving for decades to achieve.","This collection of essays and articles provides a survey of cultural criticism, theory, and commentary that specifically focuses on the evolution of black theatre, performance, and the performing arts from the nineteenth century to the present day. The fields of black theatre criticism and performance studies encompass a heterogeneous array of critical methodologies, theoretical paradigms, and journalistic, literary, and historical writings. This collection therefore brings together a combination of period-specific articles, aesthetic essays, and academic criticism in order to chart the development of a discursive tradition that evolved alongside pathbreaking innovations in black performance culture. Because formal theatre and dramatic productions historically served as central forms of employment, social exchange, and cultural representation for African Americans from the Reconstruction era through the mid-twentieth century, this volume places a particular emphasis on examining critical writing that focuses on drama and theatre. The collection includes essays and articles that explore cultural themes, early goals, and the long-term influences of key players in the field.This introductory essay provides an overview of black theatre and performance studies by contextualizing the development of these fields both chronologically and thematically. For each period, seminal work crucial to understanding the fields of black theatre and performance studies is included. The collection pays special attention to minstrelsy, vernacular folk culture, civil rights activism and cultural history, black nationalism, black feminism, and experimental and avant-garde theatre movements.",2501742225,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Brooks, Daphne", Copyright © ProQuest LLC.

Children's Literature (New Zealand),"While in many aspects the development of New Zealand's children's literature is analogous to that of Australia, four specifically local themes can be distinguished - the settlers' reactions to their new environment, relationships between Maori and Europeans, the idiosyncratic elderly, and the conservation of New Zealand's unique flora and fauna.

The earliest writers were absorbed with the strangeness of the land, its uncompromising bush-covered mountains, its rushing waterways and its indigenous inhabitants, the Maori. But while the 'settler' stories were concerned with the difficulties of adapting to the land and to the vast distances from 'civilization', the 'adventure' stories by overseas writers such as G. A. Henty, R. E. Horsley and Jules Verne made considerable capital from the disputes between Maori and settlers.

Many of the 'settler' books were the result of diaries or letters 'home' to England, and were predominantly written by well-educated women such as Lady Mary Ann Barker. The first book about the Land Wars by a New Zealand-born author, William Satchell's The Greenstone Door (1914), poignantly depicts the conflict of loyalties inherent in any civil war, a dilemma frequently articulated in New Zealand children's literature, particularly in the writing of contemporary author Anne De Roo.

By the 1890s a generation of European children had been born in New Zealand, but there were few indigenous books catering to younger readers. This resulted in a flurry of activity to write fantasy stories that either retold Maori legends or used the 'flower fairy' theme, so popular overseas, to instruct children about New Zealand flora and fauna. These books were predominantly didactic and of little literary worth, but one author who developed the genre to its maximum potential was Edith Howes.

The works of Isabel Maud Peacocke dominated the post-First World War period, giving a good picture of daily life and the consequences of the war.

New Zealand writers of the period were undoubtedly influenced by such overseas writers of girls' stories as American Louisa May Alcott, Canada's Lucy Maud Montgomery and Australia's Mary Grant Bruce and Ethel Turner. It was in direct response to Turner's Seven Little Australians (1894) that Esther Glen, a Christchurch journalist, wrote Six Little New Zealanders (1917), a lively account of six children who visit their uncles' farm in Canterbury.

The school story, popular overseas in the works of authors like Angela Brazil, never achieved the same popularity among New Zealand authors. Only two series of New Zealand school stories were written at this time. The first, the Hilda at School stories by Phillis Garrard, is set in a North Island day school and includes Hilda at School, A New Zealand Story (1929), The Doings of Hilda (1932), Hilda's Adventures (1938) and Hilda Fifteen (1944). The second, the MERRY stories of Claire Mallory (pseudonym of Winifred Hall), is set in a South Island girls' boarding school and includes Merry Begins (1947), Merry Again (1947), Merry Marches On (1947), Leith and Friends (1950) and The Pen and Pencil Girls (1950).

Although the 1930s and 1940s were lean years for New Zealand publishing, constructive measures were taken to address the scarcity of books for children. The establishment of the School Library Service (1942) and the New Zealand Library School (1946) provided books and trained children's librarians. By the 1940s the School Journal, a series first published in 1907 as school readers, had become a major source of fiction and poetry for children. The work of some of New Zealand's finest children's writers, including Margaret Mahy, Elsie Locke and Ruth Dallas, was first published here.

The institutional market promoted more overtly nationalistic stories for children, and the 1950s saw titles like On a Farm in New Zealand, The New Zealand Twins, or Verena Visits New Zealand. By the 1960s, the scope of local junior fiction had widened. Authors such as Phyl Wardell set exciting adventure stories in the remote South Island, and Joyce West wrote convincing novels about farming families in rural agricultural North Island districts. Interest in the early settlers was revived in stories by Elsie Locke and Ruth Dallas.

With the 1960s came an increasing awareness of the condescending and inappropriate literary depiction of Maori. Lesley Cameron Powell's Turi, The Story of a Little Boy (1963) is a landmark in its sensitive treatment of a small Maori boy who lives with his grandmother. Its sympathetic depiction of the elderly is also a recurrent theme in New Zealand junior fiction. R. L. Bacon has done much to heighten awareness of Maori legends. His Rua and the Sea People (1968) uses the device of a grandmother passing on legendary material to her grandchild. Bacon was the first to encourage a Maori artist, the well-known Para Matchitt, to illustrate a children's book, a practice continuing in fine decorative books by Maori artists Robyn Kahukiwa, Robert Jahnke, Katerina Mataira and Gavin Bishop. Another book about a grandmother, Crayfishing with Grandmother (1973) by Jill Bagnall, was not only the first full-colour picture book to be published locally but also the first to have dual Maori/English texts - a practice increasingly common in picture books.

Unfortunately, the worthy motives behind institutional pressures to produce books with overtly New Zealand subject-matter worked against the writing of good fantasy, which is more likely to be universal than regional. The stories of Margaret Mahy were initially rejected by the local market because it was deemed that her archetypal wizards, dragons and pirates were too 'English'. Her work was published in the School Journals, however, and was seen there by a USA publisher who promoted her books in America and in the UK, where she continues to be published. Mahy's success has undoubtedly inspired other writers of fantasy, and although their works are very different in mood and treatment both Anthony Holcroft and Judy Corbalis write stories that have their roots, like Mahy's, in traditional fantasy.

Since the 1980s fantasy has often been expressed in the form of science fiction, and in many of the imagined scenarios there is concern for the environment. In Maurice Gee's The World Around the Corner (1980) trees have been felled and hills levelled while people live in smoke-filled cities where factories make weapons of war. Underlying his trilogy that begins with The Halfmen of 'O' (1982) is concern for the land. Barry Faville in The Keeper (1986), Caroline Macdonald in The Lake at the End of the World (1988) and Jack Lasenby in The Conjurer (1992) all imagine future dystopias after seismic or nuclear cataclysms which have rendered the land barren.

Ken Catran's science fiction takes place in Outer Space. In his trilogies Deep Water (1992) and The Solar Colonies (1993) spaceships crewed by teenagers attempt to avoid a polluted world. The close confines of spaceships breed discord, and racial prejudice is often a cause of conflict. Catran explores the same problems in stories about the past, beginning with Neo's War (1995), that offer lively reinterpretations of the Trojan Wars. Margaret Mahy, Joy Cowley and Sherryl Jordan have written science fiction, and one of David Hill's most recent novels The High Wind Blows (2001) features astronomy and space exploration seen from this world. (See Science Fiction And Fantasy (New Zealand).)

Hill has been one of the most prolific authors writing for both young adults and the intermediate age range. A former teacher, he is distinguished by his ability to treat serious subjects with a lightness of touch. His first novel See Ya Simon (1992) gives a remarkable portrait of a boy suffering from muscular dystrophy; despite knowing that he will die, he accepts his condition and even faces it with humour. Hill courageously tackles profound emotional problems such as bereavement, but skilfully avoids sentimentality, as most of his protagonists cheerfully play sport, climb mountains, join clubs and take part in school activities.

If science fiction has been one of the fastestgrowing genres in New Zealand, fiction for 'young adults' is another. Many of these feature problems but Diana Noonan's young adults are refreshingly angst-free. William Taylor's teenagers, however, have major difficulties. They often tangle with the law, as in Shooting Through (1986), endure incest, as in Possum Perkins (1987), or find difficulties with their sexual orientation, as in The Blue Lawn (1994) and Jerome (2000). Taylor's books for younger readers, such as Agnes the Sheep (1990), are very amusing and shrewdly depict the proclivities of the upper primary age group.

Recent young adult novels have often focused on the New Zealand preoccupation with sport, and one of the best known is Tessa Duder's Alex (1987) and its sequels. They draw upon Duder's own experiences as a New Zealand champion swimmer and show considerable insight into the psychological and physical stresses of competitive sport. Duder well understands teenage girls, and in The Tiggie Thompson Show (1999) she traces the difficulties of an overweight young woman whose determination to act on television finally succeeds.

Research in the 1970s by Marie Clay, of Auckland University, and Dorothy Butler, a specialist bookseller and author, clearly demonstrated that children learn to read more readily when given high-interest illustrated stories rather than graded readers. Their findings were partly responsible for the phenomenal increase in local picture-book production. Butler herself has written a number; best known is My Brown Bear Barney (1988) and its sequels. Margaret Mahy and Joy Cowley have been prolific story writers for the under-sevens. Ronda and David Armitage's The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch (1977) and its sequels, Pamela Allen's energetic creations such as I Wish I had a Pirate Suit (1989), and Betty and Alan Gilderdale's Little Yellow Digger (1992) and its sequels have all achieved wide popularity.

Undoubtedly the best-known of recent picture books have been those by Lynley Dodd in the Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (1983) series. Dodd never treats her gallery of canine and feline characters anthropomorphically, but develops their individual characteristics as they enact their parts in everyday but amusing circumstances. The skilful rhyming texts are complemented by Dodd's own jaunty illustrations.

Although a very high standard has been achieved over the past decade in science fiction, in young adult novels and in picture books, there has been a noticeable lack of good writing for the traditional recipients of children's literature, the seven-to-ten-year-olds. The two authors most in tune with that age group are Margaret Mahy and Joy Cowley, who have deservedly received international acclaim.

Children's books by New Zealand authors are increasingly recognized overseas because of their greater diversity and improved formats. The discerning reader, however, may still identify their distinctive, but now unselfconscious, characteristics.",,2137903430,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Gilderdale, Betty"," Selection, editorial matter and their own contributions © Eugene Benson and L W Conolly 1994, 2005.

Cyberpunk Fiction,"Cyberpunk fiction is a sub-genre of *science fiction set in a near future where the world is saturated with technology. The first *novels and *films in the *genre appeared in the early 1980s. The term 'cyberpunk' was introduced as the title of a story by Bruce Bethke in 1983, and was first used to describe a genre in 1984, by Gardener Dozois. The prefix 'cyber-' comes from cybernetics, indicating the genre's concern with today's information technology, and the '-punk' refers to the subversive outcasts and street kids the genre usually casts as its protagonists.

Cyberpunk typically portrays dystopic worlds where civilisation has been shattered by environmental or political catastrophes (see DYSTOPIAN FICTION). The environment is often unstable or hostile, nation-states tend to be extinct, and land and people are divided between corporations, sects, racial, or ideological groupings. The protagonists are often poor and outsiders to existing power structures; nevertheless, they are far from powerless because they are skilled manipulators of the technology that controls most other citizens of the world. These *heroes combine the streetwise subversion of punks with a love of technology: they are wired, wear enhanced reality glasses, and are brilliant hackers, often with a moral cause. Often a portion of the narrative in cyberpunk fiction takes place in a virtual or technologically enhanced environment.

William Gibson's 1984 novel Neuromancer is one of the first cyberpunk novels, and besides introducing the word cyberspace, it has had great influence in defining the genre. Ridley Scott's 1982 film Bladerunner (based on Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) is also an important landmark. Bruce Sterling has been another important author, and his introduction to the anthology Mirrorshades is seen as a manifesto for cyberpunk fiction. Despite the repeated announcement of the death of cyberpunk, new authors further developed the genre in the 1990s, led by Neal Stephenson (Snowcrash, Diamond Age). By the turn of the century the Matrix movies had definitively brought cyberpunk themes and motifs into the mainstream.

Cyberpunk is particularly influenced by the New Wave of 1950s science fiction, where authors such as Brian Aldiss and J. G. Ballard wrote books that drew upon present problems rather than dreaming of distant planets, time travel, or technological utopias. Catastrophe has already happened in these novels, as in cyberpunk, and the nature of the disaster is close to the writer's contemporary problems with the environment, politics, and technological change. Cyberpunk is also influenced by American hard-boiled *detective fiction of the 1920s and 30s, developing both its themes of urban violence and corruption and the outsider hero, as well as by *postmodern narrative, which in turn has been influenced by cyberpunk.",,2137930548,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Walker, Jill", © 2005 Routledge Ltd, Encyclopedia Entry,, English, English, London,2010,Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory,,2010,http://silk.library.umass.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/encyclopedias-reference-works/cyberpunk-fiction/docview/2137930548/se-2?accountid=14572," Cyberpunk Fiction , Genre , Postmodernism , Fiction , Contemporary problems , Novels , Books , Science fiction & fantasy , Time travel , Sterling, Bruce , Dick, Philip K",,https://resolver.ebscohost.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Alionrefworks&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.jtitle=&amp;rft.atitle=&amp;rft.au=Walker%2C+Jill&amp;rft.aulast=Walker&amp;rft.aufirst=Jill&amp;rft.date=2010-01-01&amp;rft.volume=&amp;rft.issue=&amp;rft.spage=&amp;rft.isbn=&amp;rft.btitle=Cyberpunk+Fiction&amp;rft.title=Cyberpunk+Fiction&amp;rft.issn=&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Literature Online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dystopia,"[dis-toh-pia]

A modern term invented as the opposite of utopia, and applied to any alarmingly unpleasant imaginary world, usually of the projected future. The term is also applied to fictional works depicting such worlds. A significant form of science fiction and of modern satire, dystopian writing is exemplified in H.G. Wells's The Time Machine (1895), George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), and Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker (1980).",,2137964735,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Baldick, Chris"," Copyright © Chris Baldick 2001, 2004, 2008.

Dystopia (Part IV Subgenres),"Dystopia, the negative utopia, is “a non-existent society described in considerable detail and normally located in time and space that the author intended a contemporaneous reader to view as considerably worse than the society in which the reader lived” (Sargent 1994: 9). It is not the evacuation of eutopian hope (that belongs to the anti-utopia, which “has steadily attacked and refused Utopia and all that its authors claim for it” (Moylan 2000: 122)), but rather “draws on the more detailed systemic accounts of utopian narratives by way of an inversion that focuses on the terrors rather than the hopes of history” (Moylan 2000: 111) and works “not to undermine Utopia but rather to make room for its reconsideration and refunctioning in even the worst of times” (Moylan 2000: 133).

This dystopian inversion did appear in the late nineteenth century - in Jules Verne's The Begum's Millions (1879), H.C. Marriott-Watson's Erchomenon (1879), Walter Besant's The Revolt of Man (1882) and The Inner House (1888), H.G. Wells's “A Story of Days to Come” (1897) and When the Sleeper Wakes (1899) (Stableford 1993: 360) - and some might nowadays view the social collectivism of eutopias such as Thomas More's Utopia (1516) or Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (1888) as dystopian. However, E.M. Forster's “The Machine Stops” (1909), in which humanity has retreated to vast subterranean cities run by the Machine, has the strongest claim to being dystopia's originary text. Its depiction of “a totalizing administration that 'mechanizes' every dimension of daily life (from the organization of nature and industry to the standardization of the person) . . . develops an abstract yet critical account of the new social spacetime of the twentieth century” (Moylan 2000: 111). It opens with Vashti, listening to music and breathing fresh air pumped into her room. The opening lines - “Imagine, if you can, a small room, hexagonal in shape, like the cell of a bee” (Forster 1988: 41) - evoke both the dehumanization of living like an insect and the confinement of a (jail) cell. Vashti is a “swaddled lump of flesh” with a “face as white as a fungus” (Forster 1988: 41). Although “[i]t is to her that the little room belongs” (Forster 1988: 41), it becomes apparent that she belongs to it.

Reluctantly visiting her son Kuno, she is perpetually shocked by the “horror of direct experience” (Forster 1988: 46). Kuno, however, longs for such experience and clandestinely visits the Earth's surface, where he discovers that the Machine has been lying about the planet's inhospitability: it is habitable and there are surface-dwelling humans. Kuno concludes “it is we who are dying, and that down here the only thing that really lives is the Machine” (Forster 1988: 54). When the Machine begins to break down, humanity is left suffocating, buried alive underneath modernity's technological detritus. The real hope in this dystopian nightmare about technological dependency, dehumanization, and the sacrifice of ideas, resides not in those humans living on the surface but with the reader. It compels the reader to prevent its realization.

Key early dystopias include Yevgeny Zamyatin's critique of totalitarian rationalization in We (written 1920, translated into English 1924), Aldous Huxley's condemnation of consumer capitalism in Brave New World (1932), and George Orwell's censure of nightmarish government power in Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). Despite their differing political foci, parallels among these classic dystopias abound: wars facilitate dystopia's ascendancy; protagonists endure some trial of their newfound beliefs; women, love, and carnal desire motivate resistance; language is both an oppressive and liberating tool; quasi-religious rituals are prominent; and utopianism is pushed to the very brink of darkness. We depicts the One State as a wondrous glass metropolis that has eliminated privacy. Names have been replaced by numbers, and in that reduction “people lose their identity and are no longer unique or irreplaceable: in the world created by and for the machine, human beings become redundant” (Gottlieb 2001: 57). D-503, a mathematician, is predicated on logic and equations but haunted by uncertainty: the wonders of spring interfere “to some extent with the flow of logical thought” (Zamyatin 1972: 3); and, “in the eyes, or in the eyebrows” of 0-90, a contracted sexual partner, he finds “a certain strange, irritating X, which [he] could not capture, could not define in figures” (Zamyatin 1972: 6). We “pulls no punches in pessimistically describing the extensive power of the One State to put down individual and collective resistance” (Moylan 2000: 160); but various narrative strategies - such as casting the novel as D-503's diary, which survives beyond the One State's political control - signal a “strong . . . utopian stance” (Moylan 2000: 161).

Brave New World likewise pulls no punches in its critique of consumer capitalism, Fordism, and Taylorism. The World State, c. 2540 or After Ford 632, maintains social stability through strict eugenics and class hierarchy, the abolition of private property and independence, systematic consumption of the drug soma, and mandatory participation in sexual exhaustion and other distractions. But resistance bubbles forth. Bernard Marx, an Alpha Plus “eight centimetres short of the standard Alpha height” (Huxley 1994: 57), suffers from alienation and loneliness, while Helmholtz Watson is equally alienated because of a “mental excess” (Huxley 1994:60) and a poetic spirit that defies logic. John the Savage, a child raised on a “primitive” Reservation and on a diet of Shakespearean drama that repeatedly frames his experiences, returns to the World State only to resist its seductions. Ultimately, Marx and Watson are exiled and John, in an act of despair and defiance, hangs himself. Nevertheless, it is these poetic and alienated sensibilities that form the crux of Huxley's critique of unrestrained capitalism.

Nineteen Eighty-Four, in its “indictment of the deep tendency of modern, technologically sophisticated governments to manage reality, and as a further devastating assault upon the actual situation of the USSR in 1948,” remains “unmatched” in its pessimism that is “both distressing and salutary. Its understanding of the nightmare of power - when wielded by representatives of a species which had evolved beyond the constraints of mercy - was definitive” (Clute 1993: 896). The inhabitants of Oceania are under constant observation or threat of observation by Big Brother, leaving protagonist Winston Smith nothing of himself but the interiority of his own mind. The ubiquitous sloganeering professing Big Brother's benevolence, the perpetual surveillance which requires one to avoid committing “facecrime” and “thoughtcrime” and to learn “doublethink,” and even the threat posed by one's own children make those few centimeters a central battlefield. Oceania's citizens are repressed by a calcified and hierarchically organized regime. Smith is employed to purge factual evidence that contradicts Big Brother's official accounts of history or social policy: he drops such traces down a memory hole to be “whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building” (Orwell 1990: 40). Smith faces a similar fate: at the end of the novel, after his rebellious streak is excised through torture and brainwashing, he sits at the Chestnut Tree Café contemplating the wonders of Big Brother, but the reader knows this is merely the final stop before Big Brother drops Smith down its own memory hole. Nonetheless, Nineteen Eighty-Four ends with a slim glimmer of hope: an appendix, “The Principles of Newspeak,” which seems to have been written after the end of Big Brother (Margaret Atwood deploys a similar tactic in The Handmaid's Tale (1985)).

After the Second World War, the distinctions between utopian and sf texts collapsed as “the dystopian sensibility found a larger and more diffuse scope in the popular form of sf” and as sf “worked within an increasing enclosure of the lived moment and drew upon the dystopian sensibility even when its stories and novels were not fully cast in the classical dystopian form” (Moylan 2000: 166, 168). Moylan points to Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (1953), Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano (1952), Bernard Wolfe's Limbo (1952), and Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange (1962) as sf texts that were distinctly dystopian, and to J.G. Ballard, Philip K. Dick, and John Brunner as authors who worked “loosely with the spirit of the dystopia and produced tales of social nightmares that cannot be reduced to the strict parameters of dystopian narrative” (Moylan 2000: 168).

By the end of the twentieth century, this shared literary terrain coalesced into the critical dystopia, which tends “to be less driven by extremes of celebration or despair, more open to complexities and ambiguities, and more encouraging of new riffs of personal and political maneuvers” (Moylan 2000: 182). While using dystopia's traditional tropes, they “go on to explore ways to change the present system so that . . . culturally and economically marginalized peoples not only survive but also try to move toward creating a social reality that is shaped by an impulse to human self-determination and ecological health rather than one constricted by the narrow and destructive logic of a system intent only on enhancing competition in order to gain more profit for a select few” (Moylan 2000: 189). Such critical dystopias include Kim Stanley Robinson's The Gold Coast (1988), Marge Piercy's He, She, and It (1991), and Octavia E. Butler's Parable of the Sower (1993) and Parable of the Talents (1998), Samuel Delany's Dhalgren (1975), Pat Cadigan's Mindplayers (1987) and Synners (1991), and Ursula K. Le Guin's The Telling (2000).

He, She, and It locates resistance in Tikva, an enclave (albeit a dangerous one under constant threat of attack) away from the dystopian cities of the multis and the disease-ridden Glop. Tikva reaches “back to the models of early American town hall government, New Left participatory democracy, feminist principles of equity and self-criticism, and the socialism of early Zionism . . . Valuing optimal freedom for everyone, the citizens practice a total democracy that requires endless meetings. . . and community duties such as town labor and reforestation work” (Moylan 2000: 253-4). Against this backdrop, He, She, and It is cast as a family narrative: there is a love story between Shira and Yod, an android clandestinely built by Gadi, Shira's former lover, to protect Tikva from aggressive corporate raids; the elderly matriarch Malkah uses the story of the golem of Prague to educate Yod; and, from out of the irradiated lands of Palestine, Riva, Shira's outlaw data pirate mother (and Malkah's daughter), returns to Tikva with her cyborg lover, Nili. Moylan concludes that in “Piercy's critical dystopia, the present social order is unflinchingly portrayed through the distancing lens of its imagined alternative, but in this case the story of the people who stand up to the corporate order leads to the possibility of an eventual utopian transformation of that order . . . The social and aesthetic value of such a text therefore lies in the emphasis it places on the process of reaching toward Utopia and on the values and policies required for that process to move in a progressive direction” (Moylan 2000: 272).

The dystopian sensibility is also prevalent in comic books and graphic novels. Alan Moore has been at the forefront of the utopian graphic novel with V for Vendetta (1982-5, 1988), Marvelman (aka Miracleman; 1982) and Watchmen (1986-7). (Also of interest are: Mark Gruenwald's Squadron Supreme (1985-6); Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns (1986) and The Dark Knight Strikes Again (2001-2); Enki Bilal's Nikopol trilogy (1980-92); Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson's Transmetropolitan (1997-2003); Warren Ellis and Mark Millar's The Authority (1999-2002); Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele's The Surrogates (2006); and Justin Gray, Jimmy Palmiotti, and Daniel Acuňa's Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters (2006-7).) Watchmen exemplifies the narrative possibilities and the types of critique comics can stage vis-à-vis utopian studies. Set in a Cold War era alternative US, five minutes from humanity's nuclear midnight, it follows past and present superheroes as they untangle the complicated plot surrounding the murder of one of their own, the violent and at times sadistic Comedian. Ultimately, Rorschach, Nite-Owl, Dr Manhattan, and Silk Spectre discover that his death was simply an accidental by-product of a plot by another superhero, Ozymandias, who has decided to solve the dystopian terrors of his age by precipitating (e)utopia. When his fabricated alien invasion destroys half of New York, the world's citizens ignore their differences and reverse the Doomsday Clock. “I did it!,” he proclaims, “I saved Earth from hell. Next, I'll help her towards Utopia” (Moore and Gibbons 1987, no. 12: 19-20). Alongside the psychology of superheroism, Watchmen effectively explores the antinomies of dystopia and eutopia; yet, its dystopian darkness gets so dark that it eventually moves from dystopia to antiutopia, wherein utopia and utopianism in general are more destructive to people's lives than nuclear Armageddon or alien invasion.

Dystopia has also proven popular in film. In addition to adaptations of Fahrenheit 451 (Truffaut 1966), Nineteen Eighty-Four (Anderson 1956, Radford 1984), The Handmaid's Tale (Schlöndorff 1990), V for Vendetta (McTeigue 2005), and Watchmen (Snyder 2009), other notable films include Metropolis (Lang 1927), Logan's Run (Anderson 1976), Blade Runner (Scott 1982), Brazil (Gilliam 1985), RoboCop (Verhoeven 1987), Akira (Ôtomo 1988), Gattaca (Niccol 1997), The Matrix (Wachowski brothers 1999), Equilibrium (Wimmer 2002), Æon Flux (Kusama 2005), and Children of Men (Cuarón 2006). Dystopian worlds can also be seen in such television series as The Prisoner (1967-8), Blakes 7 (1978-81), Max Headroom (1987), and Dark Angel (2000-2).

While it is too early to predict the resilience of the dystopia in the twenty-first century or whether a new dystopian form awaits over the horizon, there can be little doubt that the dystopia thrived in the twentieth century and continues to show its health in the new millennium. It continues to embody utopianism by kicking the darkness until it bleeds daylight and to critique timely political issues while also locating hope in perhaps unexpected places: sites of resistance both within the narrative and, perhaps more importantly, within those readers who heed its warnings.",,2137960254,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Murphy, Graham J."," © 2009 Mark Bould, Andrew M.

Dystopian Fiction,"If a utopia is an imaginary ideal society that dreams of a world in which the social, political, and economic problems of the real present have been solved, then a dystopia is an imagined world in which the dream has become a nightmare. Also known as anti-utopias, dystopias are often designed to critique the potential negative implications of certain forms of utopian thought. However, dystopian *fiction tends to have a strong satirical dimension that is designed to warn against the possible consequences of certain tendencies in the real world of the present (see SATIRIC NARRATIVE). The three crucial twentieth century dysto-pian fictions are Yevgeny Zamyatin's We (1924), Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932), and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949).",,2137948720,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Booker, M.

ENGLISH NOVEL (1950-),"The very question of whether “The English Novel” -or, more broadly, an identifiably English culture-may still be said to exist in the second half of the 20th century has been the topic of much debate. Novelist Allan Massie, among others, has stated flatly that such a category ceased to make sense some 35 years ago. It might be argued that the idea of “Englishness” had long ago been rendered blurry by England's incorporation into the larger entity, Great Britain, and further by the existence of millions of colonized people worldwide who were regarded-at least nominally-as “overseas Britons.” However, after 1947, with virtually all of the former Empire now independent and with the emergence of the United States as the new Western superpower, it became apparent that England had in fact depended on its status as imperial center for self-definition. English culture was precisely not what the colonies produced; it was whatever made England and the English different. That cultural difference is no longer so clear. Public debates over the direction of English literature have made this very apparent.

By 1950, the years of scarcity immediately following World War II were coming to an end, and a period of economic growth and relative political stability had begun that was to last until the worldwide recession of the mid-1970s. However, much literature from the 1950s fails to reflect the optimism one might expect under such circumstances. While newspapers and politicians announced the advent of a class-free society with sufficient resources for all, English novelists tapped into a darker vein of disillusionment, disorientation, and, in some cases, nostalgia for the days when the English knew where they stood-both in a domestic class system and in international relations.

The emergence, in the 1950s, of several young playwrights and novelists who became known collectively as the Angry Young Men might be read as a sign of a new class mobility, an openness to new voices, but much of their work serves paradoxically to reaffirm class divisions and discontentment, despite the new affluence. These writers, including John Osborne, Alan Sillitoe, and, initially, Kingsley Amis, came from working-class or lower-middle-class backgrounds, but unlike most such writers to achieve prominence in the past they did not embrace the aesthetics of the existing (middle- and upper-class) literary establishment. Sillitoe's first novel, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1958), for example, uses grittily realistic Northampton working- class speech to tell the story of a disillusioned ex-soldier and factory worker, Arthur Seaton, who at the age of 21 owes loyalty to no one and no cause and who resolves that only the pursuit of drinking and women will give his life purpose. Amis, whose comic novel Lucky Jim (1954) satirizes the pretensions of provincial university life, gained a reputation as a philistine for this and subsequent attacks on English cultural aspirations.

Sillitoe, along with Colin Macinnes (Absolute Beginners, 1959), helped to create a presence in the reading public's imagination for a new socioeconomic group: youth. With the rise in real wages after about 1950 and high employment rates, the income of those under 21 rose at twice the rate of any other age group's. Young people who had experienced a childhood of war and rationing now had ready money for leisure spending, creating a youth culture the likes of which had never previously existed. However, novels of the time tend to evoke not so much the pleasures of increased consumption and television-fueled dreams as a sense of disenfranchisement and alienation among the young, of new desires with nothing of substance to fix upon.

This image of youths with no direction reaches its apogee in Anthony Burgess' violent dystopia, A Clockwork Orange (1962). Burgess' primary textual innovation was to create for his sinister juvenile narrator a hybrid language, rife with insider slang that sounds like Russianized English. The language evokes a familiar world rendered menacingly alien, an effect reinforced by Cold War era hints that the novel's England has become a crumbling totalitarian state.

Such negative visions of England's place in the new world of affluence were not confined to young or textually innovative writers. A similar pessimism and sense of decline may be seen in the postwar work of Graham Greene, a novelist already well established by mid-century. His acclaimed Brighton Rock of 1938 had featured a nihilistic and violent, young working-class protagonist but had held out a belief in his potential salvation. His controversial The Quiet American (1955) has lost that belief, exploring alienation on a national level, addressing Britain's eclipse as an international power. Narrated by a cynical English journalist in Saigon during the early years of covert United States involvement in Vietnam, the novel was perceived by many as anti-American for its depiction of an idealistic but fatally naive young CIA operative. While not necessarily nostalgic for British imperialism, The Quiet American portrays a new world order with little to recommend it over the old.

Lord of the Flies (1954), by Greene's slightly younger contemporary William Golding, while also stylistically distant from the gritty realism of Sillitoe and company, articulates a similar sense of social pessimism. Critics have often seen Golding's work, from this now classic first novel to his Booker Prize-winning Rites of Passage (1980), as falling outside prevailing literary movements and categories-as neither “realistic” nor “experimental” ; its characteristic, almost allegorical evocation of universal patterns of human tragedy apparently owes more to Aeschylus than to the post-war boom. However, Golding's major novels enact the rejection of welfare-state humanist optimism and a sense of the persistence of class-based division and violently irreconcilable perspectives common to the influential novels of mid-to-late century.

Such bleak visions may have contributed to the feeling on the part of many readers and writers alike that, by 1960, English fiction suffered from a profound lack of vitality. Widespread uncertainty about where England was going may have translated into uncertainty about the direction of the English novel, and a certain scepticism toward the new applied not only to content but also to form. While late-modernist experimentation, from Nabokov to Beckett to Burroughs, received critical acclaim in the United States and France, experimental novelists in England, such as B.S. Johnson and Christine Brooke-Rose, tended to be ignored or denounced. Realism has had a deeper and longer-lasting -although by no means total-hold on the English novel, despite the central role played by English novelists such as Virginia Woolf and Dorothy Richardson in developing modernist techniques. That hold may be attributed in part to the English novel's tradition of representing class and social issues; and while many critics, myself included, would argue that Woolf and Joyce, for instance, are profoundly social novelists, others see the formal innovations of modernism as too individualistic and psychologically oriented to represent the public realm.

Many of the novelists who rose to prominence during the 1960s-Iris Murdoch, John Fowles, Margaret Drabble, Doris Lessing-combine realism with some degree of psychological experimentation, often in the service of social criticism. Murdoch, although originally Irish (and in some ways indicative of the blurred line between Irish and English literature), has been one of the most prolific and visible of novelists and critics in England since the mid-1950s. Her work has been short-listed for the prestigious Booker Prize-which she won with The Sea, the Sea in 1978-a record four times. Murdoch's novels, a mixture of realism and symbolism, have been praised for their dissection of complex human relationships, a dissection that is often drily analytical.

Both Drabble in The Waterfall (1969) and Lessing in The Golden Notebook (1962) address the interior lives of middle- class women going mad in their restricted worlds. Lessing is the more experimental of the two. Her epic The Golden Notebook, a work that now seems prescient, predating as it did the rise of second-wave feminism in Britain, employs a complex interwoven form operating on several fictional levels, combining novels-within -the-novel, first-person diaries, and third-person narration. This form allows Lessing to address both sociopolitical and personal- psychological aspects of her protagonist, Anna, who struggles with political isolation and threatened mental breakdown. Anna, an ex-communist, is a figure disillusioned with political engagement and with the forms of private life available in postwar England-but Lessing, like Drabble in her own style, adds a distinctly feminist angle to the familiar themes.

In the late 1960s, two enlivening shifts took place in English fiction: one was a significant movement toward postmodernism; the other, the establishment of the Booker Prize.

Fredric Jameson and others have argued that postmodernism responds to a historical moment in which images play an increasingly crucial role in structuring power relations (see Jameson, 1991). The peculiarly English form of postmodernism seems to be shaped, as were the countercultures of the 1960s, by some combination of the rich sense of possibilities accompanying a now prolonged period of affluence with a growing dissatisfaction with the range of available social and political visions. The sources of this dissatisfaction included antiwar sentiment, the recognition by many women that they were not sharing equally in affluence or opportunities, growing anti-immigrant sentiment and resistance against it, and disillusionment with former radical alternatives, prompted by the left's revulsion both at Stalinism and the crushing of the “Prague Spring” and, at home, at the compromises of the once-socialist Labour Party government with private business.

If these developments saddled writers' imaginations with the need to envision society anew, several of them took up the challenge, producing novels explicitly concerned with aestheticism, with art as a system allied with magic and infinite possibility as well as with the concrete social world. While some of John Fowles' novels are more formally conventional, The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969), with its multiple possible endings and its self-reflexive questioning of historical inevitability, set the stage for later work, such as Graham Swift's Waterland (1983), D.M. Thomas' The White Hotel (1981), Jeanette Winterson's Sexing the Cherry (1989), and Fowles' own A Maggot (1985), all novels that critic Linda Hutcheon might categorize as “historiographic metafiction,” a term she identifies with postmodernism (see Hutcheon, 1989). Such novels tend to view history as something that can be used toward numerous ends and to view the self as a fluid creation rather than an inherent given- particularly appealing ideas, perhaps, to a nation leaving its “great” imperial history and entering an unfamiliar postindustrial world order.

Angela Carter's novels, from the mid-1960s to the late 1980s, mingle the fantastic with the insistently political, in a richly artificial language filled with echoes of previous literature. Her sources tend more to popular forms such as the Gothic and fairy tales and to French philosophy and literature, from the Marquis de Sade to symbolism, surrealism, and poststructuralist theory, than to the mainstream canon of English novels. Both The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman (1972) and The Passion of New Eve (1977) are part dystopian fantasy, part picaresque, following predictably cynical narrators on journeys that are at once geographical adventures and explorations of our existing range of images and fantasies, many of them attended by dark and violent consequences, especially for women. The narrator of New Eve, meditating on classic Hollywood movies, makes explicit the connection between art or imagination and politics:

I think it was Rilke who so lamented the inadequacy of our symbolism-regretted so bitterly that we cannot, unlike the (was it?) Ancient Greeks find adequate external symbols for the life within us-yes, that's the quotation. But, no. He was wrong. Our external symbols must always express the life within us with absolute precision; ... the nature of our life alone has determined their forms. A critique of these symbols is a critique of our lives.
Carter's novels both critique and expand the existing range of social imagery.
Other writers have continued into the 1990s Carter's post- modernist strategy of recontextualizing existing language and texts, and thereby both opening them to critical examination and reinvigorating them for further uses. While Winterson's aestheticism has grown increasingly ponderous in recent years, her first four novels, from Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit (1985) to Sexing the Cherry, adapt, retell, and combine a variety of stories, from European history to fairy tales, to create a fantastical and sometimes subversive pastiche.

Martin Amis takes a different turn on postmodernist pastiche, not so much borrowing existing texts as reproducing the specialized dialects and discourses of contemporary English and American society, in novels striking for their stingingly accurate mimicry and reminiscent of Amis' father, Kingsley Amis, in their scathing humor. In Money (1984) and London Fields (1989), Amis satirizes the get-rich-quick ethos of life under the Thatcher government, creating in a later decade another version of the scepticism and dystopian visions of the “classless society” heralded in the late 1950s. A crucial difference, however, between Martin Amis' novels and those of that previous era is that Amis presents a world that is at once highly artificial-in the quoted reproduced quality of both its language and its rather cartoonish characters-and utterly without an outside or escape. His work can be vulnerable to Jameson's critique of postmodernism as a closed system of reproduced, shallow surfaces, and as parody without alternatives.

Amis is, in fact, one of the writers whose novels have caused controversy (accused of a “lack of sympathy”) when nominated for the annual Booker Prize. The Booker, established in 1969 by multinational corporation Booker-McConnell Ltd (now Booker PLC), has served admirably its stated aim of generating renewed interest in “quality” fiction in Britain (at a time when it seemed moribund), and also its less explicit goal of helping publishers sell books. The interest generated has not always been positive, but the controversies around the prize offer intriguing insights into vastly divergent opinions on the state of the English novel and into how elusive-or embattled, according to more conservative, nationalist commentators-that adjective “English” has become.

The Booker, worth £20,000 to the winner, is open to any novel published in English, and published first in England, by a citizen of Britain, the Commonwealth, or other former British colonies (excluding the United States). Despite these broad criteria, the awarding of the prize itself is a very British affair, with a changing panel of British judges, an awards ceremony televised by the BBC, and major newspaper coverage and publisher-bookstore publicity campaigns. British bookmakers, commissioned by the prize sponsors, even take bets on the finalists and the winner.

Even more, the Booker is a question of Englishness and English high culture for many observers. There has been loud dissent in years when the list of six finalists has appeared “too un-English,” or when the winning novel has been considered inaccessible. The issue of accessibility reflects concern that the Prize cannot both sustain elite culture (or serious art) and encourage popular reading. In 1994, for instance, the selection of Scottish nationalist James Kelman's somewhat experimental How Late It Was, How Late was criticized on both counts, with some commentators complaining that no white, heterosexual Englishman had even made the short list. These latter objections suggest that trends in literary novel writing-and practical questions about which novels will be celebrated and promoted-are still very much tied up with larger discomfort over England's loss of the centrality and preeminence it once assumed, culturally and politically, among English-speaking nations.

This discomfort also reflects on the fact that, like many former colonial powers, England has increasingly become a multiethnic society in recent decades. The 1950s and 1960s saw massive waves of labor migration from, particularly, the Anglophone Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent. When long-existing conditions in the Commonwealth of unequal land distribution and economies drained by export combined with acute labor shortages in Britain, many Commonwealth Britons took advantage of their lingering semicolonial status to immigrate to the mother country in search of work.

Likewise, the old imperial custom of sending the most promising sons of colonial families to be educated in England lingered, but now without the concomitant understanding that these Anglicized colonials would subsequently return to their native countries as civil servants, doctors, and the like. Thus, such prominent novelists as the Booker winners Salman Rushdie (born in India) and V.S. Naipaul (born in Trinidad) have come to England to study and stayed to write and live as naturalized British citizens. The differences between the two reflect the paradoxes of postimperial England. Naipaul, in largely modernist novels such as the Conrad-influenced A Bend in the River (1979), tends to offer grim contrasts between the inefficiency and corruption of the former colonies and the order and aesthetic vision of England; while Rushdie's postmodernist novels also depict post- colonial chaos, but simultaneously critique the racism and arrogance of the English.

Rushdie, a fascinating figure in whom to examine the paradoxes of the contemporary English novel, is probably (to his discomfort) its best-known practitioner. The death sentence issued against him for blasphemy in The Satanic Verses (1988) has not only made him a household name; it has also highlighted cultural tensions between England and the Commonwealth and among British Muslims (many of whom denounced Rushdie as an English traitor). Arguably, Rushdie's novels, most notably his brilliant Midnight's Children (1981; winner of a special “Booker of Bookers”), are indeed blasphemous, for they borrow cheerfully from history, the English literary canon, Bombay movies, and Indian sacred literature and folk traditions, regarding all with equal irreverence and subjecting all to biting satire. Nothing is sacred to them. In this, the “spicy chutney” of Rushdie's textual practice may be as English as any current aesthetic approach, reflecting profound changes in both nation and literature in the latter half of the 20th century. In 1922, when T.S. Eliot turned to sacred Indian texts for the conclusion of his epoch-defining tale of moral malaise, The Waste Land, those texts were being subsumed into, placed at the service of, a Western voice that bemoaned its lost cultural greatness. Six decades later, it is the Western voice that is assimilated into Rushdie's verbal cooking-pot, to emerge with its great tradition looking distinctly different-subject to sceptical revision and playful renewal.",,2137914373,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Pitchford, Nicola", Copyright © 1998 Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers., Encyclopedia Entry,, English, English, London,1998,Encyclopedia of the Novel (2 Volumes),,1998,http://silk.library.umass.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/encyclopedias-reference-works/english-novel-1950/docview/2137914373/se-2?accountid=14572," English Novel (1950-) , War , English literature , Pessimism , Young adults , Postmodernism , Culture , Modernism , Novels , Realism , International relations , Working class , Amis, Kingsley , Golding, William (1911-1993) , Burgess, Anthony (1917-1993)"," Hamilton, Alex. , A Bend in the River , A Clockwork Orange , Lord of the Flies , Midnight's Children , The Golden Notebook , The Remains of the Day , French Lieutenant's Woman",https://resolver.ebscohost.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Alionrefworks&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.jtitle=&amp;rft.atitle=&amp;rft.au=Pitchford%2C+Nicola&amp;rft.aulast=Pitchford&amp;rft.aufirst=Nicola&amp;rft.date=1998-01-01&amp;rft.volume=&amp;rft.issue=&amp;rft.spage=&amp;rft.isbn=&amp;rft.btitle=ENGLISH+NOVEL+%281950-%29&amp;rft.title=Work&amp;rft.issn=10519815&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Literature Online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ENVIRONMENTAL NOVEL,"[NATURE NOVEL]

In 1962 Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, the book that declared the dangers of DDT, acted as a starting gun for the modern environmental movement. Like feminism, which also has its contemporary roots in the 1960s, environmentalism has produced substantial paradigm shifts in Western societies. Two grounding ideas of the modern environmental movement may be seen to have had an effect on the novel: the idea of environmental crisis produced by human beings' unchecked or unthinking exploitation of the nonhuman world, and the idea of “ecology” -of the importance of studying phenomena in relationship to one another. As “the origins of environmental crisis lie deep in human cultural traditions” (Meeker, 1972), it is clear that the kinds of stories we tell both reflect and help to produce attitudes that are related to environmental practice.

Like the feminist novel, the environmental novel is both an entity and a perception or way of reading. Environmentalists may now be considered stock characters, appearing, for example, in G.M. Ford's detective stories set in the US Pacific Northwest. Edward Abbey's The Monkey Wrench Gang (1975) has a plot that involves environmental activism. Dealing with a group undertaking ecologically motivated sabotage in and around Utah, it is a didactic work that demonstrates, in serio-comic mode, a clear awareness of the imperatives of the environmental movement. It was written at that moment in early environmentalism when the sense of impending disaster (of “ecocatastrophe”) was the chief motivation for action. It contributed the term monkey-wrenching to the language of environmental sabotage and has served as a gleefully inspiring text for environmental activists. More recently, the plot of New Zealander Rachel McAlpine's The Limits of Green (1985) involves environmental activism.

The influence of environmental thinking on the novel may be seen not only in environmentally motivated plots but in less direct ways. Some novels produced in the last 20 years, like Australian Rodney Hall's Just Relations (1982) and Australian Beverly Farmer's The Seal Woman (1992), while expressing concern about environmental destruction, are much more diffusely related to the shift in ideas about nature and human responsibility for the environment that the modern environmental movement has helped to bring about. Formally and thematically, they reflect an ecological awareness and contribute to a rethinking of the idea of nature and of the human being's place in it. In Beverly Farmer's The Seal Woman and in Canadian Marian Engel's Bear (1976) there is a focus on thinking through the body and a new perspective on relationships with animals. Both novels reflect the conjunction of environmentalism and feminism that has produced the concept of “ecofeminism.”

Like the environmental movement itself, novels with environmental themes are found in a variety of national literatures. Postcolonial experience has encouraged an interest in the writings of indigenous peoples, and environmentalists have turned to indigenous populations to find ways of remaking the relationship between the human and the nonhuman world. Native American writer Leslie Marmon Silko's Ceremony (1977) has become a key text in environmental fiction formally as well as thematically. Marrying oral tradition to the structure of the Western quest story, it shows the power of alternative forms to break through old ways of seeing the world.

As with feminism, environmentalism can become a way of reading-a kind of attention pointing out attitudes that might not have been otherwise as readily defined. Through the lens of environmentalism, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719), for example, seems even more clearly a text that demonstrates developing Enlightenment attitudes toward the exploitation of the nonhuman world. Crusoe as colonist is also Crusoe lord of the natural world, taming it to his needs. On the other hand, Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851) may be considered a great environmental novel not just because of its attention to the nonhuman world (animals again, and the sea) but because of its questioning, through its presentation of Ahab's monomania, of what is now called “anthropocentric” behavior. James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales (1823-41) contain passages not only appreciative of landscape but demonstrating a consciousness of loss brought by human exploitation. Near the beginning of The Prairie (1823) there is a striking description of the wanton cutting down of a tree. Richard Jefferies' neglected After London (1885) is also a novel about the loss of an environment, movingly depicting an English countryside after the destruction of London. W.H. Hudson's The Purple Land That England Lost (1885) and Green Mansions: A Romance of the Tropical Forest (1904) take a naturalist's eye to South America and anticipate ways in which the natural environment, rather than being an adjunct to a human story, looms as a genuine participant. Many of Thomas Hardy's novels and the more recent Waterland (1983) by Graham Swift may be read in this way. Indeed, the very movement of literary naturalism may be seen as in some ways prefiguring the new naturalism entailed by an environmental consciousness.

A broad category of futuristic fiction has readily accommodated environmental themes. Science-fiction themes such as the colonization of other worlds and the aftermath of disaster have been attractive vehicles for writers drawn to thinking about the possibility of environmental crisis. Occasional early novels such as Jefferies' After London and Hudson's A Crystal Age (1887), . gwhile not as “scientific” as the fantasies of H.G. Wells, anticipate the marrying of environmental ideas and futuristic, sometimes dystopic, sometimes catastrophic, fiction. Ursula Le Guin has been influential in recent years in uniting environmental concerns with science fiction, producing a major work of environmental fantasy, Always Coming Home (1985). Brian W.

Introduction,"The literary map of Latin America and the Caribbean is peppered with imaginary places, from the Seven Cities of Cibola to Onetti's Santa María and the now universally recognized city of Macondo. But alongside these imaginary places sit Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Rio, the Venezuelan llano, the Brazilian sertão, the rainforest, the windswept wastes of Patagonia, the many islands of the Caribbean. All of these are contained within frontiers - political, linguistic and cultural - which are as subject to change or re-imagining as the borders of Macondo or Santa María. It is often a treacherous business to seek precise correspondence between the literary and the geographical atlases: they sometimes mirror one another, and at other times they are in a relation of mutual denial. That relationship can be a central theme, for example, as writers grapple with political issues, historical responsibilities, the consequences of economic organization, ethnic, social and gender divides, and rapid change in rural and urban life. But it is equally possible that literary expression will not take as its theme the materials of actual experience. Does that make it any less representative of the region? Do literary texts that explicitly refer to social realities necessarily express the deep configurations of lived experience? This distinction may be false in any event, since we are dealing with constructions of the imagined.

At the same time, the century that concerns us in this volume is certainly one in which the question of the relations between literature and the real world have been profoundly contested, nowhere more intensely than in Latin America and the Caribbean. This is a feature of the period that begins at the end of the nineteenth century, when Latin American and Caribbean literature began to seek forms of literary expression which, while acknowledging their debt to Europe, are nonetheless original and new. Perhaps the emphasis on novelty or originality was at first a statement of aesthetic independence from the old colonial centres (often expressed with new force during the centenary celebrations of national independence in Spanish America and Brazil, in the period between 1910 and 1922). The implications of this disengagement from the European reality, however, often produced - or demanded - a new kind of engagement with the real.

Yo persigo una forma que no encuentra mi estilo
botón de pensamiento que busca ser la rosa
Darío, Rubén

There is no doubt that the towering figure in the movement known as modernismo in Spanish America (the Brazilian movement would begin later) is the Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío. His Prosas profanas (1896) contains a preface which to all intents and purposes is a manifesto for the modernista movement. An expression of the aesthetic aspirations of cosmopolitan intellectuals in peripheral countries ('mi mujer es de mi patria, mi novia es de París'), it drew on some of the formal developments in the French literature of the time and on notions of 'art for art's sake' (Wilde, Whistler, etc.) with their implications of what could be described as an aristocracy of the spirit. The same idea is expressed in the most famous long essay of the period, José Enrique Rodó's Ariel (1900), which exhorts the youth of Latin America to follow a higher spiritual calling (associated with 'Latin' culture, presumably as much French as Spanish) against the utilitarian culture Rodó associates with the Anglo-Saxon world, particularly the United States. That key opposition echoes an earlier essay by the Cuban José Martí, who in 1891, in his essay 'Nuestra América' similarly contrasted the spiritual and the utilitarian, this time in a rousing call to cultural and political independence both from Europe and from the colossus of the north. To underline the fact that this was a general preoccupation across the continent, one could mention the growth of a modernista movement in Mexico reflected in key journals such as the Revista azul and Revista moderna. In Brazil, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis had expressed in his 'Instinto da nacionalidade' (1873) similar ideas about the distance that Brazilian literature had acquired relative to Portuguese literature (and to European literature more generally), which he (like Borges some decades later) considered something of an advantage, since it allowed for irreverence and innovation.

Darío's later work Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905) includes a number of significant political poems such as 'Canto a Roosevelt' and 'Cuauhtémoc' which are similarly concerned with the forging of a Latin American cultural identity founded on national projects informed by intellectual and spiritual ideals. Curiously these are not the most familiar poems of Darío's today, since his earlier 'art for art's sake' poems (a good example is the famous 'Sonatina') seemed to capture best the cultural aspirations of the fin de siècle. In contrast, Rodó's essay spawned a whole series of so-called 'arielista' texts, which later influenced the tradition of the essay of national identity (Alcides Arguedas, Antonio S. Pedreira, Octavio Paz, Ezequiel Martínez Estrada).

One result of these cultural interventions in the debates about political independence was in a sense to compromise the isolationism (what Darío called the 'reino interior', studied by Roberto González Echevarría in an important essay on Rodó and the supposed autonomy of art). Perhaps that was the significance of Enrique González Martínez's call in a sonnet of 1914 to 'twist the swan's neck', a call taken up later in a very different kind of poetry by the younger poets of the avant-garde.

The poets and writers who contributed to the new experimental literature assembled under the concept of the avant-garde shared common attitudes to language and form. Beyond that their views and attitudes differed greatly. In some senses, this new phase in Latin American writing challenged - or to use a current rather than a contemporary term, deconstructed - language and broke through the certainties that form enshrined. If the modernistas in some sense appropriated the symbolic universes of the fin de siècle, the Latin American avant-garde addressed and circumvented the idea of totality. Modernity as they were experiencing it was fragmentary and incomplete; it was utopia and dystopia at once. Perhaps that was in its way a function of a new communication between Europe and Latin America, an exchange of ideas and experiences that took many artists to Europe - César Vallejo, Oliverio Girondo, Vicente Huidobro, José Juan Tablada, Jorge Luis Borges - but drew European artists and writers to Latin America in search of a different cultural history. André Breton travelled repeatedly to Mexico, for example, while Le Corbusier, the key figure in architecture of that period, found his most enthusiastic following in Brazil.

While the avant-garde is a complex movement, it would be wholly wrong to see it as a mere imitation of Europe. The highly significant Modern Art Week in São Paulo in 1922 evolved into the Antropofagia movement led by Oswald de Andrade which insisted that Brazil must absorb, or cannibalize, Europe. César Vallejo dismembered the language of all the historic certainties that Europe had bequeathed to Latin America. Vicente Huidobro embarked on his extraordinary poem Altazor in 1919 and completed it with a kind of verbal cataclysm in 1931. The speed and cacophony of the modern city found echoes in the work of Girondo, the Estridentista group in Mexico, and in the writings of the group around Graça Aranha in Brazil. And the impact of the mass communications media, the beginning of cinema, the proliferation of radio, all emphasized the new possibilities and the gap between the different locations of the national experience.

In a sense, the impulse to revolutionize and transform was present throughout the avant-garde - a function of the sense of the collapse of an old order in the 1920s and onwards. Yet there was no agreement as to how that transformation might be achieved materially, nor on the relationship between the imagined new world and its political expression. Thus many writers felt their vanguardism a political obligation, broadly interpreted. The Boedo group in Argentina took its social obligations very seriously, while those who wrote for the avant-garde journals such as Martín Fierro tended towards a social conservatism in uneasy co-existence with aesthetic experimentation. For Nicolás Guillén in Cuba or the Puerto Rican poet Luis Palés Matos, the new direction was a return to the language of black or mulatto music and speech, a new encounter with orality and the invisible cultures of oppressed minorities. The indigenista writers were at least in part moved by the same concerns, yet their work was often aesthetically conservative, at least until the generation of José María Arguedas and Manuel Scorza in Peru drew on the innovative aesthetics of the avant-garde.

The 1920s and 1930s are witness to literary and cultural movements which at first sight appear to move in quite contrary directions. On the one hand, there was the regionalism that considered the issues of cultural creation through a developmentalist lens. Here the issue was to reproduce in some senses the European experience of progress and enlightenment, two functions of a single process. This is expressed particularly in the iconic novels of the era, Rivera's La vorágine (1924) and Gallegos's Doña Bárbara (1929), as well as the early indigenista writing. The essays and autobiographies of José Vasconcelos in Mexico may be seen in the same framework; he was engaged in the active construction of a new national culture in Mexico, where the Revolution of 1910-17 had inaugurated a new 'revolutionary' state. And the writings and activism of José Carlos Mariátegui in Peru may both be seen as explorations of the encounter between politics and culture in the context of a struggle to define national culture. In a different sense, Claude McKay's Banana Bottom (1933) may be set in the same framework, exploring as it does the historical experience of plantation life that informs and distorts the historical present.

In this regard, it was of particular concern to these writers that substantial sectors of the national population (peasants, blacks, Indians) remained apart from the state projects; these writers found themselves writing 'about' and yet 'for' a community which had not yet been forged, a community that had been imagined but did not exist. This leads to a literature that is plagued by good intentions: Jorge Icaza's Huasipungo (1934), for instance, while denouncing the condition of Ecuadoran Indians, reads today as a racist text, and the same could be said of a number of other products of the indigenista and negrista currents. Mariátegui stated with considerable prescience that indigenismo writes about the Indian, but that a true indigenous literature would only be written when there were Indian writers to produce it.

A new world, then, was emerging and projects for change and cultural transformation found their expression in every area of Latin American culture through the 1920s and early 1930s. But by then the impact of the Great Depression served both to radicalize the national project and bring home the material obstacles in the way of its realization. That contradiction was explored in many ways - in pastiche and parody, in a denunciatory social realism and a passionate utopianism, and increasingly in an ironic distancing. All of these features may be found, for example, in the emblematic work of the period, Aimé Césaire's Cahier d'un retour au pays natal (1939) which still carried the revolutionary impulse of an earlier modernism. Especially in the wake of the Spanish Civil War, whose effects were perhaps more immediately palpable in Latin America than the World War of 1939-45, disillusionment and withdrawal permeate a range of literary expression - from Vallejo and Huidobro to the sceptical fictions of Borges.

The beginning of the recognition of the failure of the avant-garde yields the space to a different project, often involved with a nation-building literature (sometimes closely associated with state projects). What is at stake in these cultural nationalist projects is the uncertainty about how a national culture can be forged, particularly in a culturally and economically peripheral nation and in a period of deepening crisis. It is clearly not enough for the cultural disposition to exist: there is an inescapable relationship between that disposition and the material circumstances which are a limiting condition. That is a core preoccupation, for example, of the poets and writers who gathered around Caribbean literary journals such as Bim and Kyk-over-al through the 1940s in a common search for a renewed language and a validation of the experience of the colonized. Some, such as George Lamming in In the Castle of My Skin (1953), turned to Africa; others, many of them in an exile enforced by the lack of cultural and economic opportunities in the region, recreated a Caribbean of the imagination in the language of the metropolis.

For many writers, the focus of their attention in this period of national consolidation turns towards the modern sector, and to the growing cities in which this sector is located. The hope of a leap forward into industrialization and modernity would be fulfilled in the growing urban environment - and the struggles in the countryside come to occupy a diminishing proportion of cultural attention, at least as the source of cultural renewal. The Antología de la literatura fantástica (1940), compiled by Borges, Adolfo Bioy Casares and Silvina Ocampo, was the signal for writers to return to imagined worlds, although whether those imaginary places were the product of the individual imagination or the collective unconscious would continue to be debated. For Alejo Carpentier, for example, writing in the preface to his 1949 novel El reino de este mundo, the marvellous was a facet of a Latin American reality as multi-layered and contradictory as an excited André Breton, the founder of surrealism, had hoped it would be. Julio Cortázar, José Donoso and Juan Rulfo each moved between the real and the symbolic. Juan Carlos Onetti and Ernesto Sábato moved in urban settings. The shaping development, however, was the growth of national-populist projects such as those of Juan Domingo Perón in Argentina and Getúlio Vargas in Brazil in which cosmopolitanism would often be seen as a mode of withdrawal from the construction of the state. Yet the overwhelming tenor of the times was a descriptive narrative of alternative histories, of ethnography, and of a debate on national identity expressed and developed in every area of culture, from music and architecture to narrative and theatre. Mário de Andrade, Octavio Paz, Germán Arciniegas, Gilberto Freyre, Fernando Ortiz, Augusto Salazar Bondy and many others contributed to the discussion.

In the 1950s the limits of the industrialization that occurred in Latin America were reached. On the one hand, state control over the economic process had not led to independence from the market. By the middle of the decade it was clear that while growth and urbanization had occurred, these had not served to level, let alone eliminate, the internal inequities within Latin America, or within each country. Carlos Fuentes's novel La región más transparente (1958), set in a burgeoning Mexico City, provided a vast mural of the contradictory dynamics of the capital. Juan Rulfo's iconic Pedro Páramo (1955) and Onetti's El astillero (1961) might, in their different ways, be read as allegories of the failure of a project.

Yet Fuentes, together with Mario Vargas Llosa and Gabriel García Márquez, would within the decade become Latin America's most successful cultural exports with the commercial impact of the 'Boom' in the Latin American novel. Fuentes's first major contribution to the phenomenon, his novel La muerte de Artemio Cruz, in 1962, was completed three years after, and against the background of, the Cuban Revolution. This was not a coincidence.

The Cuban Revolution of 1959 was in the first instance an event in the terrain of politics. The fall of the dictatorship of Batista, a loyal defender of US interests in the region, and the triumphant entry into Havana of the revolutionaries of the 26th of July movement, resonated around the continent. The hegemony of the United States throughout Latin America - its ability to use its ideological influence and economic power to control events - had been successfully challenged. What followed, in Washington, was what John Gerassi called the 'great fear' that such a challenge might be mounted elsewhere. In Latin America itself, the overthrow of Batista privileged the Cuban experience in all subsequent political debate. Its methods became the model, and its project for national independence the road to follow.

The rejection of US hegemony was at once political and cultural; the new Cuban government under Castro returned to the question of national culture and its role in nation-building that had been such a central preoccupation for earlier cultural movements. Its first formulation - though not necessarily a very clear one - came in 1961, when Castro delivered his 'Words to the intellectuals' at a conference in April of that year. The phrase that crystallized his injunction became something of a formula - albeit one whose imprecision allowed endless re-interpretations - 'Within the revolution everything, outside the revolution nothing'. The suggestion of open debate and flexibility was a little disingenuous, especially when a number of Cuba's pre-revolutionary intellectuals found themselves under mounting pressure to write for the revolution, as opposed to simply within it. Increasingly, as the decade wore on, loyalty to the revolution and loyalty to the Cuban government were deemed to be one and the same thing. In Cuba itself, this produced a number of debates among Latin American writers who had initially supported the revolution, for example, Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes. Julio Cortázar, the Argentine writer who was an enthusiastic supporter, took part in a three-sided debate with Vargas Llosa and Oscar Collazos (published in 1971) around issues of creative freedom for the writer and the imposition of 'acceptable' styles and models of writing. And the whole issue came to a dramatic crisis in 1968, with the announcement of the result of the Casa de las Américas prize for that year.

Casa de las Américas was a project the purpose of which was to bring together Latin American writers and artists who supported the Cuban Revolution and shared its aspiration to create a new Latin American culture. The assumption was that these two kinds of commitment were interchangeable. Yet while the innovative work of Cuban filmmakers and musicians was opening new creative avenues, the situation of writers became less clear, especially if they expressed an unwillingness to 'place their writing at the service of the revolution'. Thus, when the results of the prestigious Casa prize competitions were announced, they included the poet Heberto Padilla and the playwright Antón Arrufat among the victors. Yet when their work was published, both were prefaced by critical official statements that denounced their questioning of the revolutionary project in their respective works. A year later, Padilla was detained by the Cuban authorities and released only after he had made a humiliating confession of his errors.

For many Latin American intellectuals, this represented a parting of the ways. A new generation of young poets and writers of fiction - as well as some more seasoned - held to the limits set down by the cultural policies of the Castro government, producing forms of expression that in some way or another adhered to notions of social responsibility and public testimony. And just as it did in the economic and military realm, the United States responded with a sustained cultural challenge enshrined in an ill-fated journal - Mundo Nuevo - edited in Paris by Emir Rodríguez Monegal (and later continued in Buenos Aires by others), which drew together both critics of the Cuban regime and those who in a more nebulous way defended intellectual freedom and creative individualism.

Yet the debate about literature and its social function was not easily reduced to political positions. For just as the idea of a revolutionary poetry found echoes in the young guerrilla poets of the 1960s, writing (and dying) in Peru, Guatemala, Colombia and Nicaragua, so the argument about imaginative freedom was explored through a rediscovery of the discussions about myth and reality embedded in the concept of 'lo real maravilloso'. Wilson Harris's polyphonic novel The Palace of the Peacock (1960) in some senses marked the track. In its new manifestation, that of magical realism, the Latin American novel invaded the expanding world publishing market. Carlos Fuentes's La muerte de Artemio Cruz (1962), Mario Vargas Llosa's La ciudad y los perros (1962), Julio Cortázar's Rayuela (1963) and, most dramatically of all, Gabriel García Márquez's Cien años de soledad (1967) marked the peaks of what became known as the Boom. The term defined the group only in terms of its commercial success. A number of critics followed who set out to define its aesthetics or, in the case of Donoso, its social origins. No consensual explanation emerged, but the phenomenon of what Fuentes called 'la nueva novela latinoamericana' can tentatively be situated historically and in terms of literary histories and developments. It is not a coincidence, for example, that the new novel coincided with the economic re-integration of Latin America into the world market after the failure of a model of import substitution (and its attendant cultural projects) to open the way to forms of autonomous development. From the perspective of Europe and North America, by contrast, a new generation was turning its gaze towards a third world seen as enshrining in some sense an unmistakable reality of oppression and resistance. If magical realism drew into a single narrative the conflicting perspectives of the official and the unofficial histories, the written and the spoken, the historical and the mythic, then that could and did respond to a political and ideological vision centred on the inescapable conflicts - class, national, sexual and ethnic - which characterized a global capitalist system.

In poetry, too, these conflicts are enacted as challenges to language and within language - in Ernesto Cardenal, Nicanor Parra, Brazil's mimeograph poets; in theatre, performance as an extension of public debate and a means of personal transformation, is an idea developed in and through the work of Augusto Boal and his followers and, in a different sense, through the theatre movement in Colombia that has Enrique Buenaventura at its heart. In the same sense the poets of 'nation-language' and the spoken and performed word brought the subversive impact of orality into the very heart of an Anglophone literary world in the 1960s and 1970s. In prose fiction, Kamau Brathwaite echoed that new direction.

Yet the 1970s are, in some sense, a time of reflux, a reassessment of the revolutionary possibilities in the light of the repressive military regimes now established in Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil and Guatemala. The critical impulse so characteristic of the previous decade has made culture an enemy of tyrannies. The earliest decrees of the Pinochet regime in Chile, for example, identified and banned a series of cultural expressions. Exile became an identifying shared experience for many Latin American writers and artists and as a result the creation of imaginary countries or a withdrawal into the past in a search for explanations - or perhaps even solace. Augusto Roa Bastos's Yo el Supremo (1974) and Carpentier's El recurso del método (also 1974) may stand as examples. For those who remained within the repressive national milieus, the critical voice became often oblique and obscure, allusive and challenging as much by the collapse of reason as by an alternative rationality - Diamela Eltit and Raúl Zurita in Chile, or Ricardo Piglia in Argentina, for example.

At the same time the work of Manuel Puig in Argentina and Luis Rafael Sánchez in Puerto Rico, or the new crónica form developed particularly in Mexico by Carlos Monsiváis found resistance and distance in the vocabulary of mass culture - a new rhetoric, or anti-rhetoric, at once pastiche and critique. Its development was theorised in its turn by Néstor García Canclini and Roberto Schwarz.

It is one of the curiosities of the Boom that while it was extraordinarily influential and widely disseminated outside Latin America, it produced very few younger adherents on the continent itself. It may be that the engagement with history, whether from a conservative or a progressive point of view, that was at the heart of the movement, seemed less possible in the real conditions of the 1970s; it may be that historical optimism encountered its limiting experience in the overthrow of the Allende government in Chile. Whatever the reason, the literature of the late 1980s did not return to the ample visions of the decade of the 1960s, despite the 'transition to democracy' which largely replaced military by civilian governments across the continent. The revolutionary voices of Nicaragua, in the wake of the 1979 Revolution, were increasingly compromised by the tenuous hold of the Sandinistas on power and by what appeared to be at best the stalemate, at worst the defeat of the resistance elsewhere in Central America. It seemed that by and large writers now jealously preserved a degree of distance from their subjects, preferring instead to explore psychological and subjective landscapes.

It was that very process which produced a major debate around the issue of authenticity and self-expression. If the voice of the oppressed had not echoed with sufficient strength in the works of magical realists, 'how then could the subaltern speak', to use Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's now famous phrase? One answer was the 'literatura de testimonio', the direct narrative in which the 'author' was solely a facilitator, exemplified by the autobiographical accounts of Rigoberta Menchú and Domitila Barrios among others. The difficulty, it soon emerged, was that the agent - the scribe - could not be and never was neutral, but instead in translating orality into the realm of the written embedded it precisely within the dominant culture itself. Worse still, that echoed back on to the speaker, according to David Stoll, so that the authentic voice became a conscious participant in a narrative genre.

It is hard to define the contours of the contemporary writing scene in Latin America and the Caribbean because many phenomena are taking place and are difficult to place in perspective. A few observations are possible, however. One is the solid place in contemporary writing of voices that might once have been considered to come 'from the margin', though that very formulation seems offensive now. Derek Walcott's Omeros (1990) shifts the heartland of cultural enquiry to an unmistakable Caribbean milieu - from the centre to the margins. Women's writing is central everywhere, and women are an important share of the reading public: the public success around the world of Isabel Allende was more a symptom than a catalyst, with important voices such as Elena Poniatowska and Carmen Boullosa in Mexico, Zee Edgell and Zoila Ellis in Belize, Ana María Del Río in Chile, Ana Lydia Vega and Mayra Santos Febres in Puerto Rico. Another central fact of literary production today is the importance of gay and lesbian writing, with central figures such as Juan Pablo Sutherland and Pedro Lemebel in Chile, Mario Bellatín in Mexico, Sylvia Molloy in Argentina, and Norge Espinosa and Pedro de Jesús Pez Acosta in Cuba. Indigenous and mestizo writers, including Elicura Chihuailaf in Chile, Humberto Ak'abal in Guatemala, and a whole array of Paraguayan poets who write in Guarani, are bringing to fruition Mariátegui's predictions about the emergence of an indigenous literature, and are exploring the literary possibilities of indigenous languages (some of which did not have written traditions in the past) and of bilingual writing. Writing by African-Latin Americans and African-Caribbeans - including such important voices as Nancy Morejón in Cuba and Mayra Santos Febres in Puerto Rico - are central to the literary scenes in their countries.

If today's world is increasingly fluid and dislocated, then the displacement of writers has also become a central part of this story. While some writers have long written from the metropolitan centres - V.S. Naipaul in England is perhaps the pre-eminent example - recent displacements have affected writers of the most diverse class, ethnic and racial backgrounds, and have often resulted in linguistic displacement as well. Julia Alvarez of the Dominican Republic, Edwidge Danticat of Haiti, Cristina García and Achy Obejas of Cuba, all of whom live in the US, have written their literary work in English. The 'border arts' performance movement, associated especially with the name of Guillermo Gómez Peña, has made aggressive use of Spanglish and of a sharp questioning of fixed identities. Some artists are working across not just languages but media, as is the case of the Chilean Catalina Parra. And the growth of new expressions, like the urban 'crónicas', suggest that the local may have found ways to subvert the global culture market in literary acts at once transient and as dynamic as the constantly changing speech of the Latin American street. Thus the curiously eclectic writings of the Zapatista leader Subcomandante Marcos suggest just such a will to speak from the margins to the discontented heartlands of the megacities of the new millennium. The relation in some has reversed, and the brutal realism of the inner city, or the slums, ironically has come to fascinate and terrify the global audience for film and the new harsh fictions of inner-city alienation. It may be a peculiarly appropriate sign of the times that the golden lands that brought the colonizers to Latin America's shores over 500 years ago should now have become Paulo Lins's 'Cidade de Deus' and Patricia Melo's Inferno (1999), from which the excluded watch knowingly the explosive growth of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and await the reckoning so subtly suggested in the apocalyptic fables of Mario Bellatín, Fernando Vallejo or Diamela Eltit.

Legends and Myths (South Africa),"European settlers worldwide approached unknown territories and peoples with mingled trepidation and hope and, naturally, perceived them through the lenses of long-embedded Eurocentric conventions and legends.

No European legends survived translocation unmodified: in South Africa by the 1830s a Cape newspaper mocked travellers for their fears of 'dragons and chimera', and Nathaniel Isaacs laughed at his own abortive search for a Natal unicorn. Transported myths inflected settlers' texts in structure and attitude rather than in content, in ways analogous to early travellers' inscriptions of alien landscapes using Burke's Enlightenment aesthetics. Legend-laden tropes helped formulate, and were chosen to reflect, European settlers' governing ambivalence between arrogance and guilt, conquest and assimilation - ambivalence that critic Abdul JanMohamed has termed colonialism's 'Manichean aesthetic'.

Two interlocking pairs of legends - those of the Lost City and lost Eden and, secondly, those of 'Noble' and 'Ignoble' savages - are prominent metaphoric frames for settlers' reactions to Africa's intractable difference. First, tales of the Lost City and of lost Eden, like America's El Dorado, have exercised the European imagination from Homer's Elysium and Dante's terrestrial paradise to Prester John and present-day Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe inspired multiple romances, from H. M. Walmsley's The Ruined Cities of Zulu Land (1869) and Henry Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines (1885) to John Buchan's fusion of legend and fear of Zulu rebellion in Prester John (1910).

The mythical cities function partly as an extension of imperial urban culture; invariably built and governed by whites, they embody a wider derogation of African achievement. Thus, Zimbabwe is attributed to Phoenician enterprise, just as the Zulus, Walmsley's protagonist avers, 'sprang from... Pharoah's seamen'; Shaka Zulu's innovative predecessor Dingiswayo is instructed by a stray English doctor; the Xhosa hero Makanna in M. Norbet Morgan's Bronze Napoleon (1940) is Persian; and Zulu and Xhosa circumcision customs developed from Jewish rites.

Contradictorily, stories of unreachably beneficent cities implicitly criticise both Western 'progress' and its offshoot, colonial urban culture. As H. C. Bosman notes in his ironic lampoon, 'Lost City' (1951): 'The expedition doesn't have to leave Johannesburg, if it's a lost city it wants.' Throughout South African literature a Utopian element thus intersects with myths of the classical Arcadia, the biblical Eden, and protean varieties of the pastoral.

J. M. Coetzee notes that, unlike America's retreating frontier, South Africa's topography has been antagonistic to the Edenic: the ambivalently threatening titan Adamastor - figuratively immanent in Table Mountain for poets from Camoens to Sydney Clouts - and the Australia-like desert interior have been the more enduring tropes of a frontier literature simultaneously disillusioned, increasingly uncomfortable with a literary vocabulary inherited from England, and obsessed with race. Though numerous writers, from W. C. Scully in the 1890s to Elsa Joubert (in her The Long Journey of Poppie Nongena, 1980, first published in Afrikaans in 1978), have assumed an 'African voice', this South African Garden is serpent-infested, and the serpent is generally the black man. The teeming-Eden travelogues of many early hunters such as John Barrow (Travels into the Interior of Southern Africa, 1806) and William Burchell (Travels in the Interior of Southern Africa, 1822) attempted textually to excise the presence of aboriginals altogether; later Edens were to be reconstructed by Puritanical 'cheerful toil' in the face of non-cultivating and therefore degenerate 'savagery'. South Africa spawns neither a neo-primitivist school like Australia's Jindyworobak Movement nor an eco-frontiersman of the stature of American James Fenimore Cooper's Natty Bumppo.

Nevertheless, versions of paradise continue to inform South Africans' inscriptions of their place on the land, from Rider Haggard's adventurers, escaping from tawdry mercantilism, through Bosman's sardonic anti-bucolics and Jack Cope's story 'Power' (in his collection The Man Who Doubted, 1967), in which a boy's compassion for a trapped bird halts an entire electricity network, to Dalene Matthee's tragic elephant-and-woodcutter pastoral Circles in a Forest (1984).

The tensions among the values of Garden and anti-Garden, humanitarian dream, disappointed dystopia and exploitative progress are reflected in the second pair of legends: those of the Noble and the Ignoble Savage. Antiquity's Ethiopian Prince and anthropophagi, the medieval Wild Man, and Aphra Behn's Oroonoko are refurbished in South African settler literature to combat the depredations of the slave trade and the exigencies of frontier conflict. Little belief in Noble Savagery survived early contact, however. As with Australia's Aborigines, Chain-of-Being hierarchies and bowdlerized Darwinism justified the extermination of the Khoi-san and the dispossession of the Bantu. Persisting sporadically from Rider Haggard's Umslopogaas to Uys Krige's story 'Death of the Zulu' (in The Dream and the Desert, 1953), the Noble Savage was resurrected only with the decisive crushing of African resistance.

In a society dominated by apartheid's ossifying frontiers, the Wild Man - libertine, ungovernable, animal, unintelligible - has greater mythic currency, and popular literature relegates blacks to the clichés of blood-lust. More complexly, the ambiguities of Roy Campbell's poem 'The Zulu Girl' (in Adamastor, 1930), for example - where paradisal sensuality suckles the 'old unquenched... ferocity of beaten tribes' - echo in the related and recurrent theme of 'going native'. Instances of this theme range from the ethnocentric horror of Captain Frederick Marryat's The Mission (1845) to both the sympathetic 'white bushman' stories of Laurens Van Der Post and Wilbur Smith's The Burning Shore (1985). The legendary figure of Robinson Crusoe hovers here, explicit model for innumerable shipwreck fictions and actual colonial careers, from the work of Nathaniel Isaacs, through Henno Martin's The Sheltering Desert (1957, translated by William Kimber), to Coetzee's de-constructive Foe (1987).

As Coetzee's post-modernist fiction acknowledges, more pernicious than an understandable distortion of African realities by Eurocentric tropes are the hegemonic ends to which those figures are turned. Old legends, appropriated to the context of apartheid, 'transform history into Nature', to use Roland Barthes's phrase, becoming unquestioned local myths essential to social hierarchies and ethnic identities. Nowhere is this clearer than in the myth of Shaka Zulu.

The figure of Shaka (assassinated 1828) dominates the historical landscape of the sub-continent as a thrillingly monstrous tyrant and military genius to generations of whites, as a heroic liberator to blacks from African National Congress (ANC) founder Pixley Seme to present-day Zulu supremo Mangosuthu Buthelezi, as the subject of liberationist dramas from Zambia to Senegal, and as the namesake of a Zulu public holiday, a pop singer, a brand of shoes and a Namibian healer. In 1989-90 alone, Zulu chiefs condemned ANC youth for 'making King Shaka's land dirty'; a self-styled 'white Zulu' invoked him as hero; Afrikaaner right-wingers warned of his heritage of violence; a lecturer recommended Shakan organizational methods to Zimbabwean businessmen; and an American university student was dismissed for calling another student 'Shaka Zulu'. Such demotic manifestations are as important as, and nourish, the 'literary'; all things to all people, Shaka has become a primary constituent of both white and black self-consciousness.

Despite the stirring story of illegitimacy, exile, bloodthirsty insanity and military acumen, entrenched in dozens of educational texts, novels, poems, television films and brochures, little of Shaka's reign is known for certain. Oral traditions are extensive but contradictory; the three white eyewitness accounts are mendacious and inconsistent. The seminal portrait in Nathaniel Isaacs's Travels and Adventures in Eastern Africa (1836) of a 'ferocious and unrelenting despot... a giant without reason' draws less on demonstrable evidence than on the fictional rhetoric of the Gothic, and is clearly an instrument in the book's propaganda campaign for white colonization of Natal. Yet this lurid portrayal is that which is most often plagiarized and quoted, from Cornwallis Harris's The Wild Sports of Southern Africa (1839) to James Michener's The Covenant (1980).

The appeal of the monstrous, though rooted in often-unrecognized legend, is tenacious because it reconfirms the half-truths of prejudice and serves more pragmatic political structures. In A. T. Bryant's massive and central Olden Times in Zululand and Natal (1929), for example, Shaka is a Satanic 'arch-demon' who obliterates a paradisal idyll; whites arrive 'in the nick of time' to rescue the blacks from self-immolation. Himself a priest, Bryant follows nineteenth-century missionaries in commandeering to evangelistic ends a fictionalized Shaka - 'God's scourge to offending nations', as William Holden called him in 1866. Similarly, the baseless notion of Shaka's 'depopulation' of the interior was conjured to conceal the brutality of white incursion.

Fiction easily supersedes evidence. Hence, E. A. Hitter's novel Shaka Zulu (1955), the most popular work on the Zulu, interleaves extensive plagiarisms from Bryant with invention, but until recently was cited as a credible source, even in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The 'Battle of Gqokli Hill', repeated in almost every subsequent account as a key demonstration of the tactical genius of this 'Black Napoleon', for example, is a pure fabrication of Ritter's.

Such unquestioning repetition is the myth's hallmark, as are its unexplored contradictions. Shaka Zulu partially restores Shaka to 'Noble Savage' status, but also dovetails familiar episodes of sexual abandon and gratuitous violence, reminiscent of both Arcadia and Hades. These antinomies, however, still govern works as recent as Louis du Buisson's 'investigative' The White Man Cometh (1987); the narrative structures of heroic adventure and folk tale, necessary components of popular myth, continue to inhibit methodical scholarship (see Popular Writing (South Africa)).

The misconceptions spill into British and American accounts, such as Donald Morris's The Washing of the Spears (1965); nor are black South Africans immune. Missionaries' fictionalized, vernacular school-readers contaminated 'oral traditions' collected decades later; at least some current Zulu propaganda owes its lineaments to Ritter. Ritter and other whites in turn owed much to myth-laden African works such as Thomas Mofolo's Chaka (first published in Sotho in 1925 and in English, under the same title, in 1931, translated by F. H. Dutton) and R. R. R. Dhlomo's UShaka (1937).

This protean projection of complex fears and desires, torn between ethnology and entertainment, Utopia and savagery, thus reflects in many ways the deeper argument in settler literature between personal lyricism and public 'commitment'. The novelist Ahmed Essop refers to this tension as South Africans' 'twin temptations', as the struggle between the desire 'to take up arms against a sea of troubles' and the wish 'to retreat into misanthropy and solipsism'.",,2137913629,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Wylie, Dan"," Selection, editorial matter and their own contributions © Eugene Benson and L W Conolly 1994, 2005.

NEW ZEALAND NOVEL,"The story of the novel in New Zealand is inevitably bound up with the story of the emergence of a distinctive national culture from a dependent colonial context and, more recently, with its increasing closeness to international culture. The story starts with the importation and adaptation of British and US fictional models before moving to the exploitation and then exploration of indigenous themes. The maturation of New Zealand fiction was matched by the emergence of an indigenous reading public and a publication infrastructure to serve it. The story may be traced through four distinct but overlapping periods: the pioneer period (1840-89), the late colonial period (1890-1934), the provincial period (1935-64), and the postprovincial period (1965 to the present).

The late 18th-and early 19th-century exploratory expeditions to New Zealand gave rise to several works of prose fiction, but the first published novel to be written in New Zealand seems to have been Henry Butler Stoney's Taranaki, A Tale of the War, published in 1861, more than 20 years after the beginning of organized European settlement. It is typical of the novels of the pioneer period in several ways: it was written in the midst of a busy colonial life by an amateur writer (the only exceptions to this amateurism were British writers such as Samuel Butler or Benjamin Farjeon, who resided for brief periods in New Zealand and then returned to England); it incorporated the three major fictional modes of the time-naive documentary realism, didacticism, and melodrama; it was intended as a justification of the colonial endeavor; and it was a very bad novel. It was atypical only in that it was published in New Zealand for a New Zealand audience, while most novels of the period were published in London for an English audience, to inform them about life in the colonies. (Serialized novels, appearing in newspapers and obviously aimed at a local audience, never achieved publication as books.)

Documentary realism was the most obvious mode to present New Zealand materials to a primarily English audience. Some of the early novels were thinly fictionalized autobiographies presenting the author's experiences in New Zealand in a loose, picaresque sequence, as in William Mortimer Baines' The Narrative of Edward Crewe; or, Life in New Zealand (1874), with its artless accounts of fishing, pig hunting, milling and dam building, gum digging, and goldmining in the New Zealand of 1850. Often such adventures were given a kind of containing shape by a melodramatic plot, usually a romance. Alexander Bathgate defined the formula for this kind of book when he described his Waitaruna: A Story of New Zealand Life (1881) as a series of “true pictures of life in the southern portion of the colony of New Zealand ... strung together, as it were, by a story.” A different kind of work of documentary realism was the ethnographic description of Maori life in fictional form, such as John White's Te Rou; or, The Maori at Home (1874).

A few novels of the period were written in a didactic mode. They often contained elements of autobiography or romance but subordinated these to the didactic intent. Ellen R. Ellis' Everything Is Possible to Will (1882) uses autobiographical fiction to present opinions about marriage, feminism, and the moral fiber needed for successful colonization. Prime Minister Julius Vogel's strange Anno Domini 2000; or, Woman's Destiny (1889) uses a more romantic plot to present Vogel's ideas about sexual equality, the British Empire, and a welfare state based on economic expansion and increased consumption. Vogel's didactic novel, like Ellis', ends with an essay. The most interesting of the didactic fictions is Samuel Butler's Erewhon (1872), which moves from a realistic picture of life in the Canterbury high country as he had experienced it to a presentation of an imagined society “over the range” on the West Coast of the South Island as a vehicle for a satire of English society.

The dominant form of the period was the melodramatic romance, with the indigenous materials simply plugged into the imported structures of Victorian popular fiction. One popular variety was the Maori romance, fitting Maori elements to the conventions popularized by Sir Walter Scott and James Fenimore Cooper, as in the Australian Rolf Boldrewood's “War to the Knife”; or, Tangata Maori (1899), which dealt with the Land Wars of the 1860s. A similar exploitation of New Zealand materials was evident in the South Island goldfield romances such as Vincent Pyke's lively Wild Will Enderby (1873). Rather more complex in plot structure was a group of sensation novels written in imitation of Wilkie Collins and using. New Zealand materials within the formulae that Collins established. Oliver Growden's Matthew Redmayne: A New Zealand Romance (1892; serialized in 1889-90 as The Mark of Cain) was the most elaborate of these.

Whatever the modes, these early novels were mostly justifications of the colonizing endeavor as well as the Victorian work ethic and the doctrine of imperial expansion that lay behind it. They praise the pioneer purpose of building a “better Britain of the South Seas” and present the Land Wars as necessary for achieving that purpose. Attitudes varied from those who saw the Maori as noble savages sadly but necessarily sacrificed to progress, as did Boldrewood, to those who, like John Featon in his didactic The Last of the Wakatos: A Sensational Tale of the Province of Auckland (1873), wanted a war of extermination to eliminate all obstacles to pioneer material progress. However, several of the most interesting novels of the period step outside both the conventional fictional modes and these accepted attitudes. Sygurd Wisniowski, in Tikera or Children of the Queen of Oceania (published in Polish in 1877 but not translated into English until 1972) rejects the conventions of melodrama and romance in favor of a kind of picaresque realism through which he presents a thoughtfully critical view of New Zealand settler society, both in its material aspirations and in its race relations. Similarly, George Chamier's Philosopher Dick: Adventures and Contemplations of a New Zealand Shepherd (1891) and its sequel, A South Sea Siren: A Novel Descriptive of New Zealand Life in the Early Days (1895), present an intelligently sceptical view of Canterbury society in the 1860s. Loose, capacious picaresque novels in the 18th-century mold, they are held together by the development of the hero from naive idealism to a tempered realism.

The late colonial period, despite some abortive attempts to found national literary journals, saw no real development of an indigenous reading public or publishing infrastructure. Most New Zealand novels were still published in England and aimed primarily at an English audience. There was no development of a coherent indigenous literary tradition. Nevertheless, in isolation from one another, four significant novelists (three of them New Zealand-born) developed between 1890 and 1930, each producing at least four novels: Edith Searle Grossmann, William Satchell (the only immigrant among them), Jane Mander, and Jean Devanny. All of them worked within and to some extent transformed the main modes and attitudes of the period, although none of them received much recognition.

Grossmann, an outspoken radical feminist, worked primarily in the didactic mode. Her In Revolt (1893) and its sequel, The Knight of the Holy Ghost (1907), express through heightened symbolic moral melodrama an exalted vision of the period's faith in social progress. She presents the struggle for female equality as part of “our efforts to emancipate the race from the past and make ways for its evolution in the future” (as she put it in the preface to the 1907 novel). Her last novel, The Heart of the Bush (1910), attempts to present an ideal relationship between man and woman but is able to do so only by slipping into an escapist pastoral idyll. None of the many other didactic novels of the turn of the century were as powerful as Grossmann's at their best, but all shared with them some form of faith in social evolution, whether focusing on temperance or women's rights or trade unionism or projecting the accomplishments of the liberal government onto a utopian future.

That faith in social evolution also underlies most of the melodramatic romances of the period. Satchell in The Land of the Lost (1902), The Toll of the Bush (1905), and The Greenstone Door (1914) expresses that optimism most fully in works that in some ways transcend the melodramatic romance but still depend on its plot contrivances. Buoyed by religious faith in spiritual evolution (which found most explicit expression in the symbolic romance of 1907, The Elixir of Life), Satchell saw the pioneer effort and the Land Wars as painful but necessary steps toward achieving the better society of the future. A similar, if more limited, vision of social progress underlay many of the period's melodramatic romances set in frontier society, including John Bell's In the Shadow of the Bush (1899), and was present in the melodramas of marriage by “Alien” (Louisa Baker), published between 1894 and 1910, and those of frontier and empire by “G. B. Lancaster” (Edith Lyttleton), published between 1904 and 1943. Both Baker and Lyttleton achieved popular success in England and the United States.

Devanny in her first seven novels (her last nine were written and set in Australia) set out, like the heroine of her Lenore Divine (1926), to write books “instinct with the germs of progress, vital to achieve, a real fighting force for the good of the race.” Her vision of social progress, a strange amalgam of feminism, Marx and Engels, social Darwinism, and Nietzsche, was the most radical of these late colonial novelists, and her method was the crudest. She seemed to be struggling to find something like D. H. Lawrence's method of presenting intense feeling, but she fell back into rhetorical melodrama.

Mander, Devanny's older contemporary, had a similar but less radical faith in evolutionary progress, “the flow of the great human current that carries all men, great and small, towards some goal of understanding and goodwill which they see as in a glass darkly,” as she described it in her first novel, The Story of a New Zealand River (1920). That tendency, she thought, was toward a more enlightened society, no longer hindered by puritan repression, with greater social and sexual equality and more opportunity for individual fulfillment. Mander's mode for presenting this, a typically English blend of realism with modified romance, was more conservative than Devanny's and was also more successful, especially in Allen Adair (1925), the best novel of the period.

A similar blend is found in some of the other significant novels of the period, such as Arthur Adams' Tussock Land: A Romance of New Zealand and the Commonwealth (1904), which incorporates elements of realism and begins to move beyond reliance on the contrivances of melodramatic romance. Alan Mulgan's Spur of Morning (1934) successfully blends romance and realism and reprises most of the important themes of the age, viewing the hardships of frontier life, the destruction of the bush, the disruption of Maori culture, and the relative lack of a European high culture as necessary costs of the early stages of the struggle for social progress. Mulgan's two heroes, one a New Zealand nationalist, the other an anglophile, represent the divided national culture of the age, looking fondly back to England (Mulgan published in 1927 a popular book about a visit to England called Home: A New Zealander's Adventure) but also beginning to develop a sense of nationalism (Mulgan's autobiography, published in 1958, was entitled The Making of a New Zealander).

The revolution that New Zealand writing underwent in the provincial period, beginning in the 1930s, can be dramatically shown by placing Alan Mulgan's novel next to Man Alone, a novel by his son John, which appeared only five years later. The differences in attitude and method are profound. That literary revolution is usually seen as beginning with the publication of the first issue of the periodical Phoenix at the University of Auckland in 1932. For poetry that view holds, but the novel lagged behind both poetry and the short story, so that the new structure of feeling did not find expression until late in the 1930s with John Mulgan's novel and the novels of Robin Hyde. That changed structure of feeling emerges from an interchange between Alan Mulgan and Robert Chapman in the literary periodical Landfall in 1953. Chapman, in his classic essay “Fiction and the Social Pattern: Some Implications of Recent N. Z. Writing,” saw the fiction writers of the previous 20 years as practicing a critical, even clinical, realism to expose “what lies beneath the crust of the everyday” and to offer “a clinical report ... on the state of the patient,” a report that indicated that the patient was suffering from an overdose of irrelevant imported Victorian puritanism and needed a dose of healthy new-world humanism. Alan Mulgan protested, stating that “the main business of the novelist” was not this “deliberate sociological probing and exposure” but rather the entertaining and uplifting of the reader by showing “what is right” with society. John Mulgan's novel, published in England in 1939 but finally reprinted in New Zealand in 1949, engages in Chapman's brand of critical “probing.” It provides a model both for the critical analysis of society (with its sharply observed portrait of New Zealand between the wars as a constricted puritan and capitalist society) and for the method of that analysis (a Hemingwayesque vernacular realism focusing on the figure of the marginalized man alone whose interactions with his society show its deficiencies). As early as 1934, in his essay “Some Aspects of New Zealand Art and Letters” in the periodical Art in New Zealand, the poet A. R. D. Fairburn had said that Huckleberry Finn was “from the point of view of the New Zealand writer ... the most important novel ever written,” and his point was validated within several years when Frank Sargeson revolutionized the New Zealand short story by drawing on Sherwood Anderson as an exponent of the Twain tradition. Mulgan's use of Ernest Hemingway as a model for his novel was a further development in the same direction, as was David Ballantyne's choice of James T. Farrell for his model in his first novel, The Cunninghams (1948), a critical exposure of the cultural poverty of New Zealand provincial life. Ian Cross' independent discovery of Anderson as a model for his first novel, The God Boy (1957), resulted in a classic account of the difficulties of growing up puritan (in this case an Irish Catholic variety of puritanism).

At the same time that this US-inspired mode of critical realism was employed to present a critical view of New Zealand society, other novelists were developing a modernist mode for a similar vision, taking Virginia Woolf, Katherine Mansfield, James Joyce, and William Faulkner as their models. Robin Hyde drew on Woolf and Mansfield for a more internalized, impressionistic method. She presents isolated men and women as victims in New Zealand society between the wars in Nor the Years Condemn and focuses on the pains of growing up puritan in the autobiographical The Godwits Fly (both 1938). Sargeson turned to the Joyce of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man for his semi-autobiographical I Saw in My Dream (1949), while Janet Frame used a method closer to Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury for her semi-autobiographical Owls Do Cry (1957)-both intense accounts of the trauma of growing up in a society that was “homogeneous, dull, conformist, philistine, puritanical, bourgeois, materialist, Anglo-Saxon, and hostile,” to quote from Peter Simpson's analysis of the provincial novelist's sensibility (see Peter Simpson, Ronald Hugh Morrieson, 1982). Other novelists stayed closer to traditional English models while presenting somewhat less critical views of New Zealand society, as did the expatriates Dan Davin in his Roads from Home (1949) and James Courage in his The Young Have Secrets (1954), further accounts of growing up in New Zealand.

By 1960, the provincial novel had an established set of themes and methods. It had declared a kind of postcolonial independence from the English novel (as part of the cultural nationalist agenda of the period's literature) and had something of an indigenous readership and the beginning of a cultural infrastructure. Nevertheless, the situation presented difficulties for the novelist. From its inception in 1939, the weekly New Zealand Listener reviewed New Zealand fiction, and the literary quarterly Landfall, founded in 1947, published not only reviews but also occasional critical articles, while both journals published short stories. However, there was not such a clear path for the publication of novels. The Caxton Press of Denis Glover, the main publisher of the significant poetry and short fiction of the period, published few novels. The few established conservative New Zealand publishers accepted novels occasionally, depending on their editors, but there was no regular outlet. Thus Ballantyne's and Cross' first novels were published in the United States and all of Hyde's were published in England, as were Sargeson's. While there was some critical celebration that an unprecedented number of promising novelistic debuts were made in the years 1957 to 1959, including not only Cross and Frame but also Sylvia Ashton-Warner, Ruth France, M. K. Joseph, Marilyn Duckworth, Errol Brathwaite, and Gordon Slatter, only Frame, Brathwaite, and Slatter were published in New Zealand.

At the end of the period, the provincial novel widened its focus to include Maori experience in Noel Hilliard's Maori Girl (1960), to take on a fuller social range together with its historical origins in Cross' After Anzac Day (1961), and to present a whole community in cross-section in Bill Pearson's Coal Flat (1963), but Cross and Hilliard could not find a New Zealand publisher, and Pearson's book was published in New Zealand only after considerable difficulty. It was recognized on publication as the major novel of the period, answering Sargeson's call for a book that would “seek out the threads of our lives, and show us where they all lead to.” However, it had taken Pearson about ten years of on-and-off part-time writing to finish the novel and another three years to get it published. It remained his only novel.

Difficulties of the sort that Pearson faced have eased in the years since 1963. Since then full-time novelists have arisen, such as Maurice Shadbolt and Maurice Gee, although most must supplement their income from novels with journalism or children's books or writing for television. About two-thirds of all New Zealand novels ever published have appeared since 1965, mostly published in New Zealand by local firms (including active university presses) or by the local branches of multinationals. This unprecedented flow of fiction has gained a new audience, so that when Keri Hulme's The Bone People won the Booker Prize in 1984 the writer received something like the acclaim of a national sporting hero. Alan Duff's Once Were Warriors (1990) became part of the national debate on race relations (intensified when the novel was made into a successful film). The conscious national culture that the provincial writers had desired, the “invention of New Zealand” that poet Allen Curnow had called for in his dialogue with Ngaio Marsh in 1945 (in Yearbook of the Arts), has taken shape, and the novel has played a vital part in the process. The cultural ties to England have become as loose as the economic ones after England's entry into the common market. Ironically, cultural independence from Britain was realized at the same time that New Zealand drew closer to international culture and a multinational free-trade economic system. To date, despite the invasive power of US popular culture, evident especially in New Zealand television, the presence of such forces has not overwhelmed the growth of a vigorous national culture.

The postprovincial novel, then, has developed in a situation of cultural expansion and rapid social and economic change. Such changes have come in two waves, 1984 marking a convenient line of demarcation. In the 1960s and 1970s, increasing affluence (and threats to it in the form of Britain's move toward Europe and of the oil shocks) brought increased urbanization and suburbanization, the sexual revolution, the feminist revolution, Maori urban migration and the growth of Maori cultural and political consciousness, the emergence of a more distinctive youth subculture, and changes in family patterns. The second wave of change, which engulfed the country with the election of the Lange Labour government in 1984, has seen a continuation of the earlier changes, qualified by the rise of the new capitalism and the end of the Cold War and its alliances and oppositions. Recent developments include an increased economic and social individualism, increased economic stratification and the retrenchment of the welfare state, increased economic internationalization, and radically changed patterns of immigration bringing more cultural pluralism. These and related phenomena have given novelists very different material from the more narrow, monocultural society of the previous period, material for which the conventions and explanatory patterns worked out in the provincial novel are no longer entirely suitable.

Social change has resulted in an increasing diversity of theme and mode in the novel. Through the late 1960s and the 1970s, the critical realism and the humanistic values of the provincial novelists remained dominant, but they were much modified to take in social change. They moved beyond a simple opposition to a puritan monoculture, widening their vision to include those who had been excluded or marginalized by the provincial novel, especially women and Maori. The emergence of a younger generation of writers not raised under puritanism in the 1980s and 1990s has brought an even greater diversification of subject, attitude, and mode, expressed in an increasing quantity of novels.

Some postprovincial novels, such as Gee's In My Father's Den (1972), sharply contrast a period from the provincial past with the present, to show the extent of social change. Others, such as Gee's Plumb family trilogy (Plumb, 1978; Meg, 1981; Sole Survivor, 1983) or Maurice Shadbolt's Strangers and Journeys (1972), trace a long curve of social change. More frequently, novelists directly confront contemporary society, some in large social cross-sections, as in Barbara Anderson's Girls High (1990), others in smaller domestic groups, as in Duckworth's Disorderly Conduct (1981), or in a focus on isolated characters, as in Shonagh Koea's The Grandiflora Tree (1989). Fiona Kidman's True Stars (1990) and other novels of society focus on political and social issues, but the great majority center on personal relations. These differ from the novels of the provincial period in their greater emphasis on individual rather than social responsibility, in their more psychological or therapeutic approach to their characters, and in their greater willingness to deal explicitly with sexuality. The period is marked by increasingly frank treatment of various forms of sexuality, whether it be heterosexual passion, as in Sheridan Keith's Zoology (1995), male homosexual love, as in Witi Ihimaera's Nights in the Gardens of Spain (1995), lesbian love, as in Renee's Daisy & Lily (1993), or even pedophilia, as in Mike Johnson's Lear (1986).

A different kind of widening of novelistic range has come about since the 1970s with the advent of Maori novelists writing about Maori life from the inside. Ihimaera in Whanau (1974) and Patricia Grace in Potiki (1986) deal with the rural Maori community in the postprovincial time of sharp social change. Grace especially focuses on cultural conflict over land. Duff in Once Were Warriors and its sequel, What Becomes of the Broken Hearted? (1996), focuses on the plight of dispossessed urban Maori. Hulme in The Bone People tries to point to new social patterns, bringing Maori and Pakeha together in new configurations that transcend past failures and break out of the confinement of the nuclear family.

Ihimaera in The Matriarch (1986) and Grace in Cousins (1992) deal with the historical aspects of the change in the Maori situation, Ihimaera going back to the Land Wars from the present and Grace going back to the 1940s. Such historical interest has been a feature of many novels of the period, and there have been historical novels on many segments of the past from many perspectives. The historical sections of Ian Wedde's Symmes Hole (1986) and Graham Billing's The Chambered Nautilus (1993) deal with the pre-1840 whaling days, while C.K. Stead's The Singing Whakapapa (1994) treats the early misionaries. The central section of The Matriarch treats the Land Wars from the Maori side, while Shadbolt's historical trilogy (Season of the Jew, 1986; Monday's Warriors, 1990; The House of Strife, 1993) looks at the same events primarily from the Pakeha side. Kidman's The Book of Secrets (1987) gives a feminist interpretation of a 19th-century religious settlement, and Rachel McAlpine's Farewell Speech (1990) presents a revisionist view of the struggle for female suffrage. Stevan Eldred-Grigg's Oracles and Miracles (1987) gives a working-class view of the Depression, Elizabeth Knox's Glamour and the Sea (1996) is a re-creation of the home front in World War II, and Stead's All Visitors Ashore (1984) presents a postmodern treatment of the 1951 Waterfront confrontation. The whole range of New Zealand history has been open to the postprovincial novelists, not for costume drama but for varied reinterpretations and revisionist readings. A range of futuristic fiction includes the feminist fantasies of McAlpine as well as postapocalyptic dystopias such as the future section of Frame's Intensive Care (1970) and the post-AIDS world of Johnson's Lear.

This great diversity of subject and attitude has been matched by a diversity in mode and method. Critical realism has not been superseded but rather has continued to develop beyond that of the provincial novelists. However, it has become less dominant, as other modes have developed alongside it. Gee, the most significant novelist of the period, through a career encompassing 12 novels, has consistently expanded the possibilities of realism. Using the model of Joyce Cary's trilogies, he developed in the plumb trilogy a use of a retrospective first-person point of view moving back and forth through several chronological levels, with three different narrators dealing with overlapping material from different perspectives in the three novels. In novels since then, including Prowlers (1987) and Going West (1992), he has further elaborated the method. He uses a shifting omniscience within a more restricted time frame with a larger social crosssection in such novels as The Burning Boy (1990), Crime Story (1994), and Loving Ways (1996). Shadbolt among others has also continued to develop the realist mode while incorporating some postmodern elements. The continued vitality of realism is evident in the work of the two most significant novelists to emerge in the 1990s, Barbara Anderson and the younger Damien Wilkins, whose The Miserables (1993) and Little Masters (1996) show an already accomplished mastery of a range of realistic techniques.

Frame's novels of the 1960s and 1970s follow Owls Do Cry in their basically modernist mode, although her most recent fiction has moved toward postmodernism. Of her modernist novels, Intensive Care shows the greatest virtuosity, with its shifting interior viewpoints, some in limited third-person, some in stream of consciousness, some in first-person narration, linked by a rich and enigmatic pattern of recurring symbol and motif. Maori novelists have been particularly innovative in their use of modernist and impressionist techniques. Hulme in The Bone People adventurously combines first- and third-person external and internal viewpoints, using interior monologue, recurring symbols, and mythic patterns. Grace in Potiki uses a similar range of techniques but for a simpler oral, storytelling effect. Ihimaera experiments with intercut levels of chronology in Tangi (1973); in his highly complex The Matriarch he combines this method with shifting first-and third-person points of view, recurring motifs and symbols, and a web of allusions to Italian opera.

More recently, New Zealand novelists have supplemented realist and modernist modes of writing with postmodern ones. Elements of magic realism appear in Fiona Farrell's The Skinny Louie Book (1992) and Christine Johnston's Blessed Art Thou Among Women (1991). An expressionist mode of presenting “Kiwi Gothic” pictures of small-town and rural New Zealand life first used by Ronald Hugh Morrieson in his novels of the early 1960s (including The Scarecrow, 1963) reappears in the nostalgic fictions of Noel Virtue (In the Country of Salvation, 1990), in the mannered novels of Terence Hodgson in the 1990s, and, most prominently, in Mike Johnson's Dumb Show (1996). A “factional” mix of fact and fiction appears in such works as Michael Jackson's autobiographical Pieces of Music (1994) and Lloyd Jones' fictionalized travel book Biografi (1993). Intertextual interplay is taken beyond allusion and parody in Eldred-Grigg's The Siren Celia (1989), which incorporates parts of Chamier's A South Sea Siren and rewrites that novel to express contemporary attitudes toward gender and class. Most striking has been the range of metafictional devices developed by contemporary New Zealand novelists. Frame, who had from early in her career destabilized her narratives by revealing “fictions” within the fictions, as in Scented Gardens for the Blind (1963) and Daughter Buffalo (1972), plays more elaborate postmodern metafictional games in Living in the Maniototo (1979) and The Carpathians (1988). Stead plays wittier, less destabilizing games in All Visitors Ashore and The Death of the Body (1986). The two most thoroughly postmodern New Zealand novels to date, Gregory O'Brien's Diesel Mystic (1988) and Anne Kennedy's Musica Ficta (1993), show the complexity of the contemporary situation in that the former uses the devices of international postmodernism to transform a recognizably New Zealand regional world while the latter employs similar devices to create a world with no overt sign of relationship to New Zealand.",,2137915223,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Jones, Lawrence", Copyright © 1998 Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers., Encyclopedia Entry,, English, English, London,1998,Encyclopedia of the Novel (2 Volumes),,1998,http://silk.library.umass.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/encyclopedias-reference-works/new-zealand-novel/docview/2137915223/se-2?accountid=14572," New Zealand Novel , Fiction , Writers , Race relations , Remakes & sequels , Audiences , Novels , Realism , Society , New Zealand literature , Butler, Samuel (1612-1680)"," Adams, Arthur H., 1872-1936 , Owls Do Cry , The Bone People",https://resolver.ebscohost.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Alionrefworks&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.jtitle=&amp;rft.atitle=&amp;rft.au=Jones%2C+Lawrence&amp;rft.aulast=Jones&amp;rft.aufirst=Lawrence&amp;rft.date=1998-01-01&amp;rft.volume=&amp;rft.issue=&amp;rft.spage=&amp;rft.isbn=&amp;rft.btitle=NEW+ZEALAND+NOVEL&amp;rft.title=NEW+ZEALAND+NOVEL&amp;rft.issn=&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Literature Online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Novel (New Zealand),"As with the history of many New Zealand cultural forms, that of the novel can be seen in terms of importation and adaptation. From the first indigenous novel, Henry Butler Stoney's Taranaki: A Tale of the War (1861), to the present, the genre has slowly and painfully been adapted to indigenous needs and conditions. Ironically, the novel has become established only in the past fifty years as it has questioned the very cultural myths of adaptation and 'progress' that it has acted out. The development of the New Zealand novel can be divided into four periods: the pioneer or early colonial (1861-89), the late colonial (1890-1934), the provincial (1935-64), and the post-provincial (1965-). The following account traces the primary themes and modes of the New Zealand novel as they have developed and changed through these periods.

The early novels, written mainly by amateur writers in the midst of busy public careers, appeared in three primary modes: naive realism, didacticism and melodrama. The first mode is best represented by Dugald Ferguson's loosely autobiographical Vicissitudes of Bush Life in Australia and New Zealand (1891) and by John White's semi-documentary and ethnographic Te Rou: or, The Maori at Home (1874); the second by Ellen R. Ellis's moralized autobiographical work, Everything is Possible to Will (1882). The melodramatic romance was the dominant mode and appeared in a variety of guises: the adventure of the goldfields, such as Vincent Pyke's Wild Will Enderby: A Story of the New Zealand Goldfields (1873); the Maori adventure story, such as the Australian Rolf Boldrewood's ' War to the Knife': or, Tangata Maori (1899); the romance of the frontier farm, such as Clara Cheeseman's three-decker, A Rolling Stone (1886); or the sensation novel, of which Oliver Growden's Matthew Redmayne: A New Zealand Romance (1892), serialized in Zealandia in 1889-90 as The Mark of Cain, is the most elaborate.

Only two novelists moved beyond these modes to a critical realism: Sygurd Wisniowski, in Tikera or Children of the Queen of Oceania (published in Polish in 1877 but not translated into English until 1972), and George Chamier, in his two novels (the best of the period), Philosopher Dick: Adventures and Contemplations of a New Zealand Shepherd (1891) and A South Sea Siren: A Novel Descriptive of New Zealand Life in the Early Days (1895).

From the first, and including Taranaki, these pioneer novels were mainly reports upon and justifications of the colonizing endeavour. Most express a strong faith in 'progress', often underpinned by a social Darwinism that justified the conquest of the Maori as both necessary and inevitable. This view is stated most strongly in John Featon's didactic The Last of the Waikatos: A Sensational Tale of the Province of Auckland (1873, by 'Comus') with its call for a war of extermination. However, there were also some critics of the settlers' conduct in the Land Wars, such as Boldrewood, W. B. Churchward in his three-decker romance, Jem Peterkin's Daughter (1892), and, most cogently, Wisniowski, who was critical of many aspects of the settler culture. Similarly, Chamier, dealing with Canterbury in the 1860s, was strongly critical of the land speculation, the provincial manners and mores, and the self-congratulating cult of progress that characterized settler culture. Anticipating the feminism that was to mark the next period, Ellis, who was an advocate of the colonizing venture and a believer in progress, was critical of the way in which the 'enforced ignorance and degraded social position' of women held back that desired progress.

Although most novels of this period were written by the authors of only one or two books, four serious novelists emerged and produced four or more novels each: Edith Searle Grossmann, William Satchell, Jane Mander and Jean Devanny. In addition, popular novelists such as 'Alien' (Louisa Baker) and G. B. Lancaster (Edith Lyttleton) established themselves. If there was scarcely yet 'the New Zealand novel', there were some New Zealand novelists.

In this period the didactic novel increased in importance, especially with such utopian fictions as John Macmillan Brown's Limanora: The Island of Progress (1903) and such feminist fictions as Grossmann's A Knight of the Holy Ghost (1907). However, the melodramatic romance remained the dominant mode, with accomplished works within a range of subgenres: the adventure romance of the frontier, represented by John Bell's In the Shadow of the Bush (1899) and Satchell's The Toll of the Bush (1905); the urban romance of manners, represented by Jessie Weston's Ko Meri, or, A Cycle of Cathay: A Story of New Zealand Life (1890); and the Maori romance, more transcended than represented by Satchell's The Greenstone Door (1914). Devanny's controversial Marxistfeminist work, The Butcher Shop (1926), combines the melodramatic with the didactic. An increasingly important mode was that of the realist Bildungsroman, found in such works as Arthur H. Adams's Tussock Land: A Romance of New Zealand and the Commonwealth (1904), Alan Mulgan's Spur of Morning (1934), and Mander's Allen Adair (1925), the finest novel of the period.

The dominant theme of the period, progress was usually seen in evolutionary terms, often involving social Darwinism. It justified the costs of the frontier effort - the destruction of the bush, the dispossession and demoralization of the Maori (usually seen either as a 'dying race' or as a race to be assimilated into the Anglo-Saxon race, the carrier of 'progress'), and the hardships suffered by the pioneers, especially as presented in the frontier romances. Progress was similarly the justification for the attacks on the 'awful disease' of puritanism and the advocacy of a new morality in Mander's novels. It was the ultimate justification for the feminism of Grossmann's novels, of Constance Clyde's A Pagan's Love (1905), and of such didactic temperance novels as Patmos (1905), written by Kate Evelyn Isitt under the pseudonym Kathleen Inglewood.

Although Grossmann, Satchell, Mander and Devanny all made heroic efforts, it was not until the late 1930s that the novel in New Zealand became established, with its own themes and conventions, in the work of John A. Lee, Robin Hyde (Iris Wilkinson), John Mulgan and Frank Sargeson - the last, in fact, more a short-story writer than a novelist. Such novelists as Dan Davin, James Courage and David Ballantyne built on this foundation in the 1940s and early 1950s, until in 1957-58 - the annus mirabilis in which Janet Frame, Ian Cross, M. K. Joseph and Sylvia Ashton-Warner made auspicious debuts - the New Zealand novel clearly indicated that it had come of age. Works by Marilyn Duckworth, Noel Hilliard, and Ronald Hugh Morrieson appeared in the next few years, with Bill Pearson's Coal Flat (1963) providing the 'big' novel called for by Sargeson that would 'seek out the threads of our lives, and show us where they all lead to'.

The recurrent themes that emerged from this blossoming of the novel were primarily expressions of a critical view of New Zealand society as failing to live up to its own myths of progress and of being 'God's own country' - a view dramatized and validated by what the Depression revealed about the society's deficiencies. The primary literary vehicles for presenting this criticism were the various alienated victims and/or rebels who had suffered from puritanism and social injustice. Sometimes the alienated one is 'man alone', not only in John Mulgan's 1939 novel of that title but also in Hyde's 'Starkie' novels Passport to Hell (1936), and Nor the Years Condemn (1938), and in such novels as John A. Lee's The Hunted (1936). Sometimes the figure is 'woman alone', as in Hyde's Wednesday's Children (1937) or Hilliard's Maori Girl (1960). More frequently the focus is on the tribulations of the child and adolescent 'growing up puritan' - from Lee's Children of the Poor (1934) through Sargeson's I Saw in My Dream (1949) to Cross's The God Boy (1957) and Ballantyne's Sydney Bridge Upside Down (1968). In some the focus is widened to the whole unhappy family, as in Hyde's The Godwits Fly (1938), Ballantyne's The Cunninghams (1948), and Frame's Owls Do Cry (1957). In such novels as Cross's After Anzac Day (1961) and Pearson's Coal Flat, the focus widens to the entire community.

Most of these novels have an underlying dualism favouring the sensitive individual against a repressive puritan society. However, in such war novels as Davin's For the Rest of Our Lives (1947) and Guthrie Wilson's Brave Company (1950), as well as in such postwar novels as Davin's Roads from Home (1949), Courage's The Young Have Secrets (1954), and Duckworth's A Barbarous Tongue (1963), criticism of society is less prominent and the emphasis is on the existential responsibility of the individual to make an accommodation with an imperfect society and an indifferent universe.

The dominant modes of the period, formulated mostly by writers critical of New Zealand society, were critical realism and modernist impressionism. The first was modelled primarily on the work of Ernest Hemingway, Sherwood Anderson and James T. Farrell. It involved character interacting with character and environment to form an open plot, without melodramatic resolution, usually presented from a restricted point of view, with dialogue in New Zealand vernacular and narrative prose in keeping with it. Primary examples are Man Alone, The Cunninghams, The God Boy and Maori Girl. The modernist impressionist mode, modelled more on the work of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield, involved more emphasis on the inner life, with extensive use of interior monologue and a more poetic prose with recurrent patterns of imagery. Prime examples are Hyde's The Godwits Fly, Frame's Owls Do Cry and Sargeson's I Saw in My Dream.

While the novelists of the provincial period formulated the themes, modes and conventions that make a tradition, they often had trouble establishing themselves as professional writers. Most had brief or discontinuous careers as novelists, as demonstrated by Mulgan, Hyde and Morrieson. Some, however, managed to last into the postprovincial period and build more substantial careers in a more propitious environment marked by a larger reading audience and a more active publishing industry, though their careers were still marked by hiatuses, as was the case with Sargeson, Frame, Ballantyne and Duckworth. In the 1960s, Maurice Shadbolt, Maurice Gee and Joy Cowley began to build careers as professional writers, as, if less continuously, did Graham Billing. In the 1970s and 1980s the number of established novelists steadily increased, and in the 1990s the growth rate accelerated. These new novelists included many members of groups not represented in the provincial period. There were Maori novelists, including Witi Ihimaera (first novel 1972), Patricia Grace (1978), Keri Hulme (1983), and Alan Duff (1990), joined by Pacific Island writer Albert Wendt (1973). From the mid-1970s onwards there was a rapidly growing group of Pakeha women novelists, the most important being Margaret Sutherland (1974), Fiona Kidman (1979), Sue McCauley (1982), Elizabeth Knox (1987), Rosie Scott (1988), Shonagh Koea (1989), Barbara Anderson (1990), Fiona Farrell (1992), Tina Shaw (1996), Catherine Chidgey (1998), and EMILY PERKINS (1998). The most significant Pakeha male writers who published first novels in these years were James McNeish (1970), C. K. Stead (1971), Ian Wedde (1976), Vincent O'Sullivan (1976), Lloyd Jones (1985), Mike Johnson (1986), Stevan Eldred-Grigg (1987), Noel Virtue (1987), and Damien Wilkins (1993). Most of these new novelists have also been active in other genres.

The greater number of novels and novelists within a rapidly changing social environment has meant real diversification of theme and mode. The first challenge that the post-provincial novelists faced was the depiction of the shift of the monocultural puritan society to a bicultural or even multicultural affluent urban-suburban consumer society. Some novels have traced that process historically, placing the present in the context of the puritan past. Shadbolt's Strangers and Journeys (1972), Gee's Plumb trilogy (Plumb, 1978; Meg, 1981; Sole Survivor, 1983), Eldred-Grigg's Christchurch trilogy (Oracles and Miracles, 1987; The Shining City, 1991; Mum, 1995), and Chidgey's In a Fishbone Church (1998) use several generations of a family to tell the story, while Kidman's A Breed of Women (1979), Anderson's A Portrait of the Artist's Wife (1992), Farrell's Six Clever Girls Who Became Famous Women (1996) and Gee's Ellie and the Shadow Man (2001) all focus on the development of individual women as feminism increasingly took hold, and Knox's The High Jump: A New Zealand Childhood tells of sisters growing up in a time of social change.

One aspect of that social change has been the movement to a more market-oriented, new capitalist society since 1984. Some novels have picked up on this, most notably Kidman's True Stars (1990) and Gee's Crime Story (1994). However, much more frequently the theme has been domestic rather than political and economic. Gee has focused on the tensions within families in such novels as Games of Choice (1976) and The Burning Boy (1990), as has Anderson in Proud Garments (1996), while Sutherland closely examined suburban marriage in The Love Contract (1976). Relationships among the counter-cultural young of the 1970s are depicted in Wedde's Dick Seddon's Great Dive (1976) while those among the Auckland young of the 1990s feature in Perkins' Leave Before You Go (1998).

Concentration on the domestic context, with its psychological emphasis, has been accompanied by an increased frankness in dealing with diverse sexualities, especially since 1990. There have been novels of obsessive heterosexuality, such as Debra Daley's The Strange Letter Z (1995); of male homosexuality, such as Ihimaera's Nights in the Gardens of Spain (1995); of lesbianism, such as Renee's Daisy & Lily (1993); of paedophilia, such as Duckworth's Leather Wings (1995); of familial sexual abuse, such as Jones's Choo Woo (1998); of the sex industry, such as Shaw's Birdie (1994). In these, neither puritan disapproval nor anti-puritan sexual rebellion is evident.

Man alone and, more frequently, woman alone feature in the period, but without the emphasis on victimization and rebellion of the provincial period. Women alone include the solo mothers in Duckworth's Disorderly Conduct (1984), the widows in most of Koea's novels, the retired schoolteacher of Frame's A State of Siege (1968), the widowed writer of her Living in the Maniototo (1979), the spinster of Cowley's Nest in a Fallen Tree (1967), and the lonely librarian of Sutherland's The Fledgling (1974). Men alone are a varied lot, mostly self-defeating, including the alcoholics of Billing's The Slipway (1973) and Ballantyne's The Talkback Man (1978), the drifting ex-farmer of Owen Marshall's Harlequin Rex (1999) or, more sympathetically, the man who thinks he sees aliens in Nigel Cox's Skylark Lounge (2000).

An important development in the treatment of post-provincial New Zealand society has been the depiction of Maori life by Maori writers. Ihimaera's The Matriarch (1986) and The Dream Swimmer (1997) and Grace's Cousins (1992) are family epics tracing the process of historical change in Maori life. Ihimaera's Tangi (1973) and Whanau (1974) show the traditional rural culture attempting to retain its values in a time of social change, while Grace's Potiki (1986) presents such a community struggling to retain its land and Duff's Once Were Warriors (1990) shows the life of the dispossessed and demoralized urban Maori. Hulme's The Bone People (1983) points towards a future that transcends cultural differences.

The growing internationalization of New Zealand society is shown in the novels depicting immigrant cultural groups and in those reaching out to other countries. Yvonne Du Fresne's fiction (such as The Book of Ester, 1982) deals with the Danish experience in New Zealand; Wendt's Sons for the Return Home (1973) deals with the Samoan; and Gee's Live Bodies (1998) with a Second World War Jewish immigrant. Conversely, Jones reaches out to Albania in Biografi (1993) and Wilkins to the USA in Nineteen Widows Under Ash (2000).

Perhaps the most spectacular growth area in the post-provincial novel has been historical fiction, usually with a revisionist view of the past: the pre-settlement past in Wedde's Symmes Hole (1986); the missionary past in Stead's The Singing Whakapapa (1994); the colonizing endeavour in McNeish's Mackenzie (1970); the Land Wars in Shadbolt's Season of the Jew (1986); a nineteenth-century religious settlement in Kidman's The Book of Secrets (1987); the Liberal era in Rachel McAlpine's Farewell Speech (1990); the early twentieth century in Sargeson's Memoirs of a Peon (1965); the 1905 All Black rugby tour in Jones's The Book of Fame (2000); the 1930s in O'Sullivan's Let the River Stand (1993); the Second World War in Kidman's Paddy's Puzzle (1983); and the 1950s in Stead's All Visitors Ashore (1984).

An opposite development has been the creation of dystopias that extrapolate present trends into a disastrous future, such as Stead's Smith's Dream (1971), Frame's Intensive Care (1970) and Mike Johnson's Lear (1986).

The widening of thematic concerns in the postprovincial period has been accompanied by a diversification of mode. The realistic mode has remained important but has been expanded in its technical and stylistic range, historical and social breadth, and psychological depth, as in the novels of Gee. The modernist impressionist mode has been further developed by Frame, Grace and Hulme, among others. A distinctive development has been that of a metafictional mode, seen in such works as Frame's The Carpathians (1988), Stead's The Death of the Body (1986), and, in a more post-modern vein, Anne Kennedy's Musica Ficta (1993). Related is the appearance of magic realism, most strikingly in Farrell's The Skinny Louie Book (1992) and Knox's The Vintner's Luck (1998).

If the development of critical realism and modernist impressionism as vehicles for a critical depiction of a puritan monoculture could be read as the 'story' of the New Zealand novel up to the 1980s, increasingly since then the novel has taken on a diverse complexity of theme and mode that cannot be contained within a single story.",,2137931689,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Jones, Lawrence"," Selection, editorial matter and their own contributions © Eugene Benson and L W Conolly 1994, 2005.

POLITICS AND THE NOVEL,"[CONDITION OF ENGLAND NOVEL]

The relation of politics to the genre of the novel is a modern question and a contentious one. In the sense that all literature and all writers are products of specific historical and cultural conditions, it is often argued that all novels are political. The apparent lack of a specific political viewpoint or of specific political material, or claims by the author of political neutrality, are seen in this context as a political stance. At the other end of the spectrum, many artists and critics have regarded any direct connection between aesthetic productions and the real world as an illusion, the result of literary and linguistic trickery. These etremes form the parameters of a debate that generally focuses on four major areas of discussion: the nature of political content and its relation to aesthetic form; the use of the novel as an agent of social change; the role of public reception in determining a novel's impact as political; and, finally, the possible tension between the politics of the writer and the politics of the writing.

When we talk about politics and the novel, it is generally assumed that we are talking about content, about the body of realistic material that provides the context, the thrust, and the rationale of the fictional narrative. Novels that are judged to be political in this sense may not necessarily describe or even refer to specific political processes and/or events, but are critical representations of social structures, social mores, and social relations. They are perceived as political partly because of the writer's viewpoint but also because of the writer's power to influence and/or change the viewpoint of the reader. More specifically, the political novel is one whose intention is demonstrably to act as an agent of social change.

Most critics would accept that definition as a starting point. However, even such apparently straightforward ideas present difficulties. Many critics claim that the relation between a writer's political viewpoint and the political statement his or her novel makes is an unstable and problematic one. The conjunction of an individual's viewpoint, a specific historical context, and a particular stage in the evolution of literary form may obscure or transform the writer's intention, giving the reader uncertainty of focus and suggesting a variety of responses. These critics would also argue that content is not easily separated from form and that the relation of politics to the novel is mediated not only through the writer and the reader but also through the literary forms available to him or her at the time. Others would claim that a novel is not a political pamphlet but a literary construct that cannot intervene in social processes the way a pamphlet may. Attempts to make it do so, such critics maintain, contradict the function of art.

However, despite these arguments, in practice many novelists continue to use their novels as social critiques and as agents of change, and the novel has continued to make powerful interventions in social and political issues. What is certain is that the novel form has always shown itself to be peculiarly suited to the investigation of social relations, emerging again and again in times of historical change and public and political crisis as the literary form of protest.

The novel's rapid rise to popularity in 18th-century England is commonly explained in political terms as closely linked to the rise of the bourgeoisie. Indeed, the novel has been called a bourgeois literary form because of its early focus on the world of the rising middle classes and its materialist perspective on the daily world of social intercourse, in contrast to the heroic themes of classical poetry and drama. However, early novels such as Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726)-a savagely specific political allegory attacking the ruling classes-and Henry Fielding's The Adventure of Joseph Andrews (1742)-a razor-sharp satire on the hypocrisy of social institutions-located the novel from the beginning in an emerging tradition of social and political commentary. However, despite the political implications of such novels, typical literary treatment in the 18th century pointed toward a moral rather than driving at political resolution.

The forces of industrialization and the rapidly worsening conditions in England's cities in the mid-19th century began to draw the novel form into closer alliance with the politics of change. Writers such as Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Dickens, and Charles Kingsley used their novels to intervene in social processes and to contribute to social reform by framing their narratives with detailed and realistic descriptions of social conditions. Elizabeth Gaskell's Mary Barton (1848) exposed the plight of the industrialized classes in Manchester and diagnosed the social malaise at the heart of class relations. Child labor, debt, poverty, and the Poor Law were issues Dickens addressed in novels such as Oliver Twist (1838), Little Dorrit (1857), and Our Mutual Friend (1865), while Charles Kingsley advocated the benefits of education for the working classes in Alton Locke (1850) and joined in the attack on child labor in The Water-Babies (1863).

These “condition of England” novels mark an important development in the political function of the novel. Although Gaskell, Dickens, and Kingsley all claimed to write from a Christian perspective for humanitarian reform and avoided political pleading, the implications of their fictions are not reformist, but revolutionary. Many contemporary readers and critics responded to them in this spirit. These novels also mark the beginning of a long tradition of British social protest novels that continued into the 20th century and includes the novels of William Makepeace Thackeray, Thomas Hardy, and George Moore. The success of these novels had the effect of transforming literary realism into a radical literary mode. In France, realism developed in the late 19th century into naturalism, which emphasized authenticity and accuracy of detail in the representation of middle- and working-class life. Émile Zola's Les Rougon-Macquart series, which includes Germinal (1885) and La Terre (1887; The Earth), exposed the misery and poverty of contemporary French society and the violence of human instincts and had considerable influence on British realist writers.

The late 19th century registered a further change in the relation between politics and the novel. Waning religious authority, the increase in literacy, and the rise of Marxist socialism and labor politics after 1880 gave the novel greater public influence and an increasingly specific political edge. This was not an entirely new phenomenon. In the 1840s in England, for instance, the Chartists-a working-class movement struggling for political freedom-had demonstrated an intimate relation between literature and politics. They had transformed popular literary forms, harnessing narrative to a specific ideological viewpoint. However, the turn of the century saw such writing becoming more frequent and more international as socialist ideas spread across the world. In the United States, works such as Jack London's The People of the Abyss (1903) and The Iron Heel (1908), socialist analyses of the injustices of capitalism, and Upton Sinclair's attack on working conditions in the Chicago stockyards, The Jungle (1906), began to appear. In England, there was a wave of socialist novels such as Margaret Harkness' Out of Work (1888), George Bernard Shaw's An Unsocial Socialist (1887), and Robert Tressell's The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists (1914). While realism continued to be the hallmark of such novels, this period also saw increasing diversity of form as writers struggled to express their social visions. Utopias and dystopias flourished, including H.G. Wells' The Time Machine (1895) and William Morris' News from Nowhere (1890) in England and Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (1888) in the United States.

In the early part of the 20th century, the emergence of modernist literary techniques and the identification of modernism with the articulation of modern sensibilities (although not necessarily of modern conditions) drove an abiding wedge between those writers who saw the world of public values and collective experience as their material and those, like Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and William Faulkner, for whom the interior world of private value and experience was paramount. The dominance of modernism in Western Europe and the United States temporarily marginalized the interest and relevance of the political as material and/or motivation for the novel.

It was not until the 1930s that politics and the novel again became a subject for public debate. This decade proved a period of dramatic upheaval and political instability throughout Europe and the United States as the Depression shook economic security and the rise of fascism in Germany and communism in Soviet Russia threatened world peace. In 1934, socialist realism was adopted as the official artistic doctrine by the Congress of Soviet Writers, a decision approved by Stalin. The doctrine of socialist realism required that the creative artist serve the proletariat, and it denounced all forms of literary experimentation as degenerate. Socialist realism is associated with a long period of literary oppression and censorship in the Soviet Union. It is interesting to note that this official use of literature as a weapon of political propaganda was of strictly limited success. On the other hand, many novels about the Russian Revolution, such as Doktor Zhivago (1957; Doctor Zhivago) by Boris Pasternak, and about Stalin's proscriptive regime, including Odin den' lvana Denisovicha (1962; One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich) and Rakovyi korpus (1968; Cancer Ward) by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, which were written to question and challenge the official party line and were banned at the time, have retained their power to influence generations of readers.

The consequence of political and literary oppression generally has been a politicization of novelists, who are encouraged to reconsider their artistic role. This was particularly true of American novelists, who had no native tradition of political writing. The Partisan Review was founded in 1934-initially in a spirit of support for communism-for the express reason of engaging writers in the historical and political process. The editors rapidly moved away from such a restrictive orthodoxy and established the Partisan Review as an influential force in making literature almost synonymous with politics by providing a platform for critical debate and new writing. The new left-wing tendency, whether accepting or critical of Stalinism, was pervasive. The new generation of writers-John Steinbeck, Erskine Caldwell, James T. Farrell, and Richard Wright-stirred their readers with powerful and moving accounts of a range of social issues, including the life of workers in the American West in Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (1939), and in the South in Caldwell's Tobacco Road (1932), urban disintegration in Farrell's Young Lonigan (1932, the first novel of a trilogy), and the plight of black Americans in Wright's Native Son (1940). Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, already established writers, changed direction to express the new social and historical concerns. For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), for instance, draws on Hemingway's experience of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.

Marxism has had a formative influence on literary theory and on our understanding of what defines a political novel since its emergence in England in the early 1880s. In their letters and essays of this period, Marx and Engels recognize the political influence of the realist novel and declare the importance of the representation of typical characters and situations. Neither of them advocated a closed ideological perspective and both praised the work of Dickens, Gaskell, the Brontës, Thackeray, and particularly the French novelist Honoré de Balzac, for their authentic and honest portrayals of the ills of their societies.

This acceptance of the difference between the politics of a writer and the political import of his or her writing has stimulated much critical debate. Leon Trotsky in Literatura i revoliutsiia (1923; Literature and Revolution) supports and extends this notion as does Georg Lukács, the Marxist critic, in Essays über Realismus (1948; Studies in European Realism) and Wider den missverstandenen Realismus (1958; The Meaning of Contemporary Realism). Lukács' self-appointed task-to rid communism of the legacy of Stalinism and to rediscover the creative core of the teachings of Marx, Engels, and Lenin-was a difficult one. He emphasized the instability of intentionality, claiming that realism was the basis of fiction and that any writer who concerned himself honestly with history and society, whatever his personal convictions, would contribute toward a socialist future.

The struggle to understand the relation of politics to the novel spilled over into the 1940s, when the debate moved on from narrow ideological concerns to the question of how political commitment and artistic autonomy can be reconciled. Two men were largely responsible for articulating the thoughts of a generation that could no longer believe in the validity of a single political truth. The first was Jean-Paul Sartre, the French philosopher, novelist, and playwright whose association with the communist party was always mediated through his search for artistic freedom. Sartre developed the idea of “littérature engagée” in his seminal work “Qu'est-ce que la littérature” (in Situations II, 1948; What Is Literature?), a refutation of the familiar criticism that politics is the death of art. In this series of essays, Sartre dismisses the idea of transcendence and universality in literature and argues that people cannot escape their historical identity and their responsibility to the age they live in. At the heart of Sartre's argument is the conviction that art has the power to liberate consciousness and to act as a kind of secondary form of action. Therefore, the writer can and should work to dispel inertia, dogma, and false emotion. Sartre's own novels, such as the Roads to Freedom series (1945-49), do not have an overt political agenda. Rather, they concentrate on the individual and offer the possibility of changing society by exploring ways in which people-as individuals- can assert or deny their personal freedom.

The second influential contributor to the politics and literature debate in this period is the Englishman George Orwell. In the essays “Why Write?” and “Politics and the English Language” (1948), Orwell argues forcefully that writers have an obligation to commit their creativity to the task of fighting social injustice, oppression, and the power of totalitarian regimes. His two last novels, exemplifying these principles, are biting political satires aimed at the threat posed to the modern world by the twin dangers of fascism and Stalinist communism. Animal Farm (1945) is an allegory that exposes the contradictions and cruelties of the Russian Revolution. Orwell's last novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), uses a realistic representation of postwar Britain cityscapes as the fictional location for a totalitarian future in a powerful narrative about the extinction of individual freedom of thought, emotion, and creativity.

Much of the literary controversy and literary history around the issue of the relation of politics to the novel is closely identified with the development of left-wing thought and the history of Western societies in crisis. It is also true that, today, to talk about the relation of writers to politics is to become aware of a whole spectrum of belief and of diverse movements which cut across national borders and historical periods. The genre of the novel still retains its political function for writers who wish to reach a wide public and, from the 1950s to the present day, has become the means by which writers construct and explore new social and political identities and help to articulate distinctive voices for African-American, African, and Caribbean communities, for women, for gays and lesbians, and for other formerly “silent” communities.

This new potential for the novel form has been stimulated by those writers and critics who have challenged the literary canon, the processes of literary criticism, and the academy, analyzing them as political projects in themselves. Feminists have been particularly successful in arguing that the marginalization of women's writing has been the direct result of male-dominated literary, economic, and political structures. The recovery, publication, or republication of “lost” women's writing from medieval times to the present, then, has political implications, whether the writing itself has a political orientation or not.

The continuing political power of the novel is illustrated by the experience of Ngugi wa Thiong'o, a Kenyan novelist whose early work-The River Between (1965) and Grain of Wheat (1967)-was written in English. His decision to write in his own language, Gikuyu, when he became an established writer was sufficiently threatening to his government that he was imprisoned. It seems that the novel is still in alliance with those writers whose mission is to inform, to criticize, and to change the society they live in and that those who hold political power are fully aware of the danger a novel may and can pose to the status quo.",,2137913596,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Hapgood, Lynne", Copyright © 1998 Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers., Encyclopedia Entry,, English, English, London,1998,Encyclopedia of the Novel (2 Volumes),,1998,http://silk.library.umass.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/encyclopedias-reference-works/politics-novel/docview/2137913596/se-2?accountid=14572," Politics and the Novel , Condition of England Novel , Writers , Socialist realism , Politics , Politics , Social change , French literature , Modernism , Brochures , 19th century , 20th century , Social classes , Child labor , Working class , Wells, H G (1866-1946) , Hemingway, Ernest (1899-1961) , Steinbeck, John (1902-1968) , London, Jack (1876-1916) , Swift, Jonathan (1667-1745) , Solzhenitsyn, Aleksandr (1918-2008) , Dickens, Charles (1812-1870) , Pasternak, Boris Leonidovich (1890-1960)"," Archer, Geoffrey. , Arrowsmith, Pat , Bellamy, Edward, 1850-1898 , Curtis, George William, 1824-1892 , Dickens, Charles, 1812-70 , Disraeli, Benjamin, Earl of Beaconsfield, 1804-1881 , Dobbs, Michael, 1948- , Gaskell, Elizabeth, 1810-65 , Gray, Alasdair. , Greenwood, Walter, 1903- , Kingsley, Charles, 1819-1875 , Locke, David Ross, 1833-1888 , Rorty, Richard , Shaw, George Bernard, 1856-1950",https://resolver.ebscohost.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Alionrefworks&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.jtitle=&amp;rft.atitle=&amp;rft.au=Hapgood%2C+Lynne&amp;rft.aulast=Hapgood&amp;rft.aufirst=Lynne&amp;rft.date=1998-01-01&amp;rft.volume=&amp;rft.issue=&amp;rft.spage=&amp;rft.isbn=&amp;rft.btitle=POLITICS+AND+THE+NOVEL&amp;rft.title=POLITICS+AND+THE+NOVEL&amp;rft.issn=&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Literature Online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUSSIAN NOVEL (1900-1945),"The turn of the century found the Russian novel in crisis, no major novelist having succeeded the 19th-century giants, Ivan Turgenev, Fedor Dostoevskii, and Lev Tolstoi. Instead, various groupings argued over the direction the novel was to take in a highly politicized debate. The Socialist Left propagated its revolutionary ideology, writing “around” czarist censorship. The liberal position, highlighted in a collection of essays entitled Landmarks (1909), was that the radical intelligentsia had reached an impasse and that it was time to pursue limited social goals by nonviolent means.

Writers of a socialist and liberal persuasion tended to publish with the Znanie (Knowledge, 1898-1913) publishing association, whose “Low-Priced Library” series featured mainly works of the “critical realism” type. Maksim Gor'kii, ideologically and personally close to Lenin and the Bolsheviks, joined the Znanie group in 1900. His novels Foma Gordeev (1899), Zhizn' Matveia Kozhemiakina (1911; The Life of Matvei Kozhemyakin), Delo Artamonovykh (1925; The Artamonov Business), and Zhizn' Klima Samgina (The Life of Klim Samgin, 1925-36; translated in 4 vols. as The Bystander, The Magnet, Other Fires, and The Spectre) follow an identical pattern: an older generation of bourgeois entrepreneurs clashes with an emergent generation of revolutionaries, pitting fathers against sons. Gor'kii's Mat' (1906; Mother) became the archetype of the Soviet socialist-realist novel. Nilovna, the heroine, is a revolutionary worker's mother who, at novel's start, is a cowed, religious housewife, but develops into a fearless fighter for the revolution.

Among the liberal members of the Znanie group were Ivan Bunin and Aleksandr Kuprin, both primarily short-story writers. Bunin's short novel Derevnia (1910; The Village) is composed of brief episodes of life in the Russian provinces at the time of the Revolution of 1905. Sukhodol (1912; Dry Valley) tells the story of the decline of the family that owns the Sukhodol estate. Bunin is an impressionist who makes use of significant detail to generate a gamut of emotions, mostly melancholy. Kuprin, a former army officer, in his short novel Poedinok (1905; The Duel), describes the life of army officers as wretched, brutish, and tedious. Other writers of a liberal persuasion who reacted to topical issues found as many readers and were discussed as heatedly as Tolstoi or Chekhov. Such were Aleksandr Amfiteatrov (1862-1928). Their work is provocative but lacks depth.

The symbolist movement, influenced by Nietzsche, Theosophy, and the philosophy of Vladimir Solov'ev (1853-1900), generated much of what was new about the Russian novel of the 1900s. Its decadent branch showed a tendency for fin-de-siècle pessimism and a penchant for the perverse and macabre. The symbolists proper pursued religious and metaphysical ideals.

Fedor Sologub, a decadent, in Melkii bes (1908; Petty Demon) tells the story of a dull-witted and brutish schoolteacher's descent into delusions, irrational fears, and eventually murderous paranoia against a background of the banality and tedium of life in a provincial city; the novel also offers occasional glimpses of erotic enchantment in episodes featuring young people.

Andrei Belyi's fiction is defined by the notion that symbolic representation-verbal, musical, or visual-is an avenue to true reality. Techniques of musical and pictorial composition appear in Belyi's prose along with intricate language games. His masterpiece, Peterburg (1916; Petersburg), is a medley of fast and furious action (the plot revolves around a bomb), topical issues (a workers' uprising, “the yellow peril”), the topography and literary mythology of Petersburg, and a series of confused dreams.

Dmitrii Merezhkovskii authored a trilogy of historical novels: Smert' bogov: Iulian Otstupnik (1896; The Death of the Gods), Voskresshie bogi: Leonardo da Vinchi (1902; The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci), and Antikhrist: Petr i Aleksei (1905; Peter and Alexis). It reflects the idea that a Nietzschean Hellenism and Christianity were two halves of an as yet unrealized higher truth. Mikhail Kuzmin, poet, playwright, and essayist, was close to the symbolists, although he leaned toward “beautiful clarity” with respect to style and was opposed to their mysticism. His personal concern was with homoerotic experience, which is the subject of his short novel Kryl'ia (1907; Wings).

The prose of Aleksei Remizov (1877-1957) is distinguished by a persistent foregrounding of the word-as-such and a stylized diction adapted to the theme at hand. His novels Prud (1908; The Pond) and Chasy (1908; The Clock), composed of short lyric vignettes, are difficult although fascinating reading because of constant changes in the tone of the narrative voice, colloquial syntax, frequent use of poetic tropes, and the confusion of dream, fiction, and reality.

The Revolution of 1917 had an immediate effect on Russian literature. Many major writers emigrated and new groupings emerged, all ostensibly loyal to the Soviet regime. The most radical writers gathered around the journals October (1924-) and On Guard (1923-25; as On Literary Guard, 1926-32). They called themselves the All-Union or the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (VAPP and RAPP, respectively) and advocated close cooperation with the Communist Party. From their ranks came Dmitrii Furmanov, Iurii Libedinskii, Aleksandr Fadeev, Mikhail Sholokhov, and Aleksandr Serafimovich.

Pereval (Watershed), a group of less radical writers, gathered around the journal Red Virgin Soil (1921-42), edited by Aleksandr Voronskii, a Bolshevik. Pereval welcomed fellow travelers and subscribed to the principle according to which, in Voronskii's words, “consciously or unconsciously, a scholar or artist fills orders which he has received from his [social] class.” Among the signers of Pereval manifestoes were Ivan Kataev, Andrei Platonov, and Anna Karavaeva.

A group that published the journal LEF (Left Front, 1923-28) consisted of futurists, formalists, and constructivists, most of whom were non-party members but nurtured the hope that the Soviet government would welcome progressive, modernist art. The formalists, headed by Viktor Shklovskii, Iurii Tynianov, and Boris Tomashevskii, are known primarily for their critical and theoretical writings. They found the significance of the novel primarily in formal aspects, analyzing it as an aggregate of themes, motifs, and devices. The constructivists, including Boris Arvatov and Kornelii Zelinskii, sought simple formulas and models to clarify the complexity of modern life. The third grouping, the futurists, expressed an unreserved enthusiasm for scientific and technological advances, including such 20th-century phenomena as cars and planes, communications technology, and highly mechanized manufacturing and construction techniques.

LEF advocated a frankly utilitarian art, addressed to the masses in readily visualized and entertaining form. The group wished to replace fiction with “factographic” genres, such as biography, documentary, and reportage. Viktor Shklovskii wrote several novels that combine all three and Iurii Tynianov wrote some historical novels that were, in effect, scholarly biographies.

The Serapion Brothers (1921-29), an informal group of writers, took their name from E.T.A. Hoffmann's work of that title to signal their creative freedom, camaraderie, and creative spirit. Among the “Serapions” were Vsevolod Ivanov, Konstantin Fedin, and Veniamin Kaverin. Several other groups were in existence during the New Economic Policy period (1921-28), during which writers were allowed a relatively free choice of styles and topics. The Revolution and civil war were leading topics. Some writers dealt with them in a manner of “revolutionary romanticism.” Nedelia (1922; A Week) by Iurii Libedinskii, for instance, describes the heroic and tragic struggle of a rural Communist Party cell against a murderous peasant uprising. Zheleznyi potok (1924; The Iron Flood) by Aleksandr Serafimovich relates how a heroic communist leader converts a ragged band of proletarians into a disciplined fighting force. Dmitrii Furmanov used factographic reportage for his novel Chapaev (1923; Chapaev), celebrating the exploits of a Red Army general of legendary fame. Vsevolod Ivanov's trilogy Partizany (1921; Partisans), Bronepoezd 14-69 (1922; Armored Train 14-69), and Tsvetnye vetra (1922; Colored Winds) deals with the civil war in Siberia. Its basic device is that of a series of rapidly changing still images, supported by ample factographic material.

Goroda i gody (1924; Cities and Years) by Konstantin Fedin gives an account of the Revolution from an intellectual's viewpoint. Close to the 19th-century novel in many ways, it uses several formal devices that indicate its 20th-century provenance. Time sequences are inverted to signal that time is out of joint. Tone and tempo of the narrative are modulated for suspense and estrangement. Golyi god (1922; The Naked Year) by Boris Pil'niak was even more modernist. Its style, derived from Belyi and Remizov, became the model for postrevolutionary ornamentalist prose.

Other writers chose the conventional epic manner of Tolstoi. Aleksandr Fadeev's novel Razgrom (1927; The Rout) deals with the civil war in the Far East in a restrained and objective manner. The rout is that of a Red guerilla detachment by White Cossacks. Tikhii Don (1928-40; Quiet Flows the Don) by Nobel prize winner Mikhail Sholokhov is one of a number of works modeled after War and Peace. It covers life in a community of Don Cossacks from 1912 to 1922 against a panoramic background of historical events. Aleksei Tolstoi likewise sought to emulate his namesake in a novel trilogy, Khozhdenie po mukam (1920-42; Road to Calvary), which covers the same period as Sholokhov's novel but from the viewpoint of the progressive intelligentsia. Belaia gvardiia (1927-29; The White Guard) by Mikhail Bulgakov sees the Revolution through the eyes of a divided middle-class familly.

The least conventional novel dealing with the Revolution was fashioned by Andrei Platonov. His novel Chevengur (partially published in 1929, fully in 1972, in the West) tells of an imaginary city where the ideals of the Communist Revolution are fabled to have been realized within a short span of time. The quest of the simple people headed for Chevengur ends in heartbreak and tragedy. A dystopian novel, My (1924; We) by Evgenii Zamiatin, like Platonov a communist activist, appeared in English translation long before a Russian text was published, also in the West. We predicts a technological dystopia that will deprive man of his freedom and stifle emotion and artistic creativity. Other Soviet writers, Aleksei Tolstoi for one, were more optimistic in their utopian fiction.

The other main theme of the 1920s was the transformation of Russian society after the Revolution. Tsement (1925; Cement) by Fedor Gladkov is the inspirational story of a worker-activist who succeeds in resuming production at a cement plant. Cement became the prototype of the Soviet “production novel,” in which the plot is defined in terms of the production of goods or services, while the human factor plays an ancillary role. The coming of the Soviet order to the Russian countryside was also a popular subject, treated in such novels as Lesozavod (1928; The Sawmill) by Anna Karavaeva and Bruski (1928-37; Bruski: A Story of Peasant Life in Soviet Russia) by Fedor Panferov. Ivan Kataev was bold enough to describe successful small dairy farms on the very eve of collectivization in Moloko (1930; Milk).

Writers of the 1920s also dealt with real problems of Soviet society. The hero of Leonid Leonov's novel Vor (1927; A Thief) is a communist hero of the civil war who has turned to crime. Skandalist, ili Vechera na Vasl'evskom ostrove (1928; The Troublemaker, or Evenings on Vasilevskii Island) and Khudozhnik neizvesten (1931; The Unknown Artist) by Veniamin Kaverin exposed the cultural isolation, even lag, of Russia in the 1920s. These novels are set in literary and academic circles and contain portraits of some of the writers and literary theorists of the period. In a similar vein, Kozlinaia pesn' (1928; The Satyr Song) by Konstantin Vaginov draws a phantasmagoric picture of Leningrad as a cultural necropolis.

Zavist' (1928; Envy) by Iurii Olesha is a modernist tour de force. A well-organized discourse, it has no plot in the conventional sense. The whole novel is a web of ambiguities. An apparent celebration of the new order, it is also a devastating satire. It features Freudian symbolism, cinematic techniques in visual effects and treatment of time, and constant estrangement through unconventional diction, far-fetched metaphors, and bizarre imagery.

With the launching of Stalin's first Five-Year Plan (1928-32), the relative freedom of the New Economic Policy period came to an end. Many writers perished in the purges of the 1930s. A decree of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, dated 23 April 1932, dissolved all existing literary organizations and replaced them by a single Union of Soviet Writers. At their first congress in 1934, the doctrine of socialist realism was adopted as “the basic method of Soviet literature and literary criticism, which requires of the artist a truthful, historically concrete representation of reality in its revolutionary development.”

Most writers tried to jump on the bandwagon of the Five-Year Plan and collectivization. Some made study trips to industrial plants, construction sites, or collective farms. Marietta Shaginian, for instance, went to work at a newly constructed hydroelectric plant and produced the novel Gidrotsentral' (1931; Hydrocentral). Vremia, vpered! (1932; Time, Forward!) by Valentin Kataev describes a single action-packed day on the construction site of the Magnitogorsk metallurgical plant. Leonid Leonov's novels Sot' (1930; The Sot), Skutarevskii (1932; Skutarevsky), and Doroga na okean (1935; Road to the Ocean) were devoted to the construction of a paper mill, the workings of a research institute, and a railway depot, respectively. Podniataia tselina (1932-60; Virgin Soil Upturned) by Mikhail Sholokhov was the most significant novel dealing with the collectivization of agriculture. Kak zakalialas' stal' (1932-34; How the Steel Was Tempered) by Nikolai Ostrovskii joined Gor'kii's Mother and Gladkov's Cement as a communist classic. It tells the story of a working-class youth who becomes a leader in the Komsomol (Young Communists). High-minded and pure, he lives entirely for the cause, combatting defeatism, selfishness, and lax morality wherever he encounters them, even when he is stricken by a debilitating illness.

The anticipation of an impending war in the 1930s led to an emphasis on Russian patriotism and military traditions. The historical novel made a strong comeback. Aleksei Tolstoi's Petr Pervyi (1929-45; Peter the First) followed the myth of Peter the Great as a progressive ruler who made Russia strong, while also having a heart for the people. (It is known that Stalin identified with the great czar.) Viacheslav Shishkov wrote several historical novels, among them Emel'ian Pugachev (1941-47; Emelian Pugachev), about the leader of an 18th-century peasant uprising, the best of several similar efforts. Sergei Sergeev-Tsenskii told of the heroic defense of Sevastopol in the Crimean War in Sevastopol' skaia strada (1937-39; The Ordeal of Sevastopol).

Mark Aldanov emerged as a major historical novelist in emigration. AMong his many novels, a cycle linking Russia and the West in the age of Napoléon is the most remarkable: Deviatoe termidora (1923; The Ninth Thermidor), Chortov most (1925; The Devil's Bridge), and Zagovar (1927; The Conspiracy). Russian emigré literature produced far fewer novels than Soviet literature, mainly because publishing long fiction was difficult for financial reasons. Ivan Bunin produced a single novel, Zhizn' Arsen'eva (1930-39; The Life of Arsen'ev), a fictionalized autobiography.

The only novelist of real stature to emerge in emigration was Vladimir Nabokov. None of his nine short novels in Russian is set in Russia. Their ingenious and suspenseful plots are often focused on a fateful obsession. The more remarkable of Nabokov's Russian novels are Zashchita Luzhina (Luzhin's Defense, 1930; The Defense), based on a parallel between the hero's fate and a chess game (Luzhin is a chess master); Dar (published in part 1937-38, in its entirety 1952; The Gift), the story of a young writer's growth; and Priglashenie na kazn' (1938; Invitation to a Beheading), an allegory whose hero is awaiting execution for what appears to be the crime of being “different.” Nabokov's most innovative work was not written in Russian, however, and cannot be counted as part of the history of the Russian novel. As a consequence, it may be said that in the first half of the 20th century, even while an enormous range of interesting fiction was written, the Russian novel disappeared from the stage of world literature.",,2137907609,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Terras, Victor", Copyright © 1998 Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers., Encyclopedia Entry,, English, English, London,1998,Encyclopedia of the Novel (2 Volumes),,1998,http://silk.library.umass.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/encyclopedias-reference-works/russian-novel-1900-1945/docview/2137907609/se-2?accountid=14572," Russian Novel (1900-1945) , Modernism , Civil war , Russian literature , Bolshevism , Historical fiction , Political parties , Sholokhov, Mikhail Aleksandrovich (1905-1984) , Bulgakov, Mikhail Afanasevich (1891-1940)"," Balmont, Konstantin Dmitriyevich, 1867-1942 , Petrov, Yevgeny, 1903-1928 , Quiet Flows the Don (Tikhii Don) , The Gift (Dar)",https://resolver.ebscohost.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Alionrefworks&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.jtitle=&amp;rft.atitle=&amp;rft.au=Terras%2C+Victor&amp;rft.aulast=Terras&amp;rft.aufirst=Victor&amp;rft.date=1998-01-01&amp;rft.volume=&amp;rft.issue=&amp;rft.spage=&amp;rft.isbn=&amp;rft.btitle=RUSSIAN+NOVEL+%281900-1945%29&amp;rft.title=RUSSIAN+NOVEL+%281900-1945%29&amp;rft.issn=&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Literature Online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SCIENCE AND THE NOVEL,"The original meaning of the word “science” was “knowledge acquired by study,” and it was not until the 19th century that its meaning became restricted to the systematic study of the natural universe. At that time, science began to make its mark in the world, and the consequences of scientific developments frequently affected humanity as a whole. Every invention, every new theory, every new explanation of life or the universe made its effects felt in many ways. The beginning of the 19th century also witnessed the proliferation of new sciences and subsciences. These became part of the general culture of the age, which included a belief in an ultimately uniform and regular reality that left no room for randomness. Nature's laws ruled and humbled humans, as Darwin's theory of evolution showed, but they were thought to apply universally. While 19th-century science had troubling implications, it also held out the hope that humanity would ultimately be able to explain, predict, even conquer, the natural universe.

The literature of the 19th century-most noticeably its dominant form, the novel-responded to particular scientific discoveries, but perhaps of greatest importance is the way it reflects the shifts in worldview that scientific developments provoked. In the most general terms, this appears in the 19th-century novel's fascination with origins, growth, and transformation, and with progress, the struggle for existence, and extinction. It is also evident in the desire on the part of many 19th-century novelists to reconcile the implications of scientific developments and the need for religious reassurance. As science pushed back or undermined religion, literature jumped in the breach, addressing the need for adjustment in religious orientation. The need for this adjustment became more evident after the mid-century mark, with the gradual shift in philosophical perspective, from belief in a world order under divine control to the (frequently ambivalent) affirmation of human control over the natural order.

Ambivalence and Adjustment
One of European fiction's first evaluations of science, Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1818), was openly critical, identifying scientific experimentation with an overstepping of natural boundaries, and Frankenstein's monster has become synonymous with science gone rampant. Reflecting widespread fear of technological innovation, Mary Shelley's novel is a complex critique of science and its assertion of the right to pursue knowledge by any means. Shelley based her novel about the scientist who creates a monster he cannot control on an understanding of the most recent scientific developments of her day. Although the scientific background of the novel, with its Gothic trappings, may seem fantastic nowadays, Shelley took care to make it consistent with current scientific theories, including ideas about electricity that were still somewhat magical. She used this knowledge to analyze and criticize the more dangerous implications of the scientific method and its practical results. More importantly, Shelley contrasted what she considered “good” science (the classification and description of the natural world, which had been the primary focus of the sciences throughout the 18th century) to “bad” science (the manipulation of natural forces to serve man's interests, which is more typical of scientific endeavor in the 19th century).

Recent feminist criticism argues, in addition, that Shelley condemns science and the scientific method for its grounding in a gendered understanding of nature as female, which justifies its violation. Shelley compares the evil science of Victor Frankenstein and his attempts to create a living creature from dead organic matter through the use of chemistry and electricity with the natural process of procreation-which, of course, involves women, as Frankenstein's approach does not. The novel suggests, then, that Frankenstein's pursuit of science is inspired at least in part by a fear of female sexuality and the desire to evade female power. Such a suggestion finds some support in the work of recent historians of science, who have shown that many 19th-century scientific projects were little more than attempts at sexism.

The genre of the novel has not been unreservedly hostile to science, and even Frankenstein expresses a fascination with the tremendous possibilities science opens up. More than a simple moral parable against scientific hubris, Shelley's novel voices a deep ambivalence about science, which appears in many other 19th-century novels. The irrepressible optimism of the age, now usually thought of as naive, counterbalanced doubts that scientific advances in fact benefited human society. While Charles Dickens satirizes scientific “progress” as it expressed itself in the miseries of industrialization in the novel Hard Times (1854), he also celebrates the scientific spirit in Little Dorrit (1857). The work of the Spanish novelist Benito Pérez Galdós expresses a less qualified optimism about scientific achievement. Respect for science, rather than fear of it, permeates his massive novel Fortunata y Jacinta (1886-87; Fortunata and Jacinta). This novel derives some of its cheerfulness from the fact that it has managed to integrate evolutionary theory with its religious convictions. Shifting the emphasis from the past to the future, it discerns in the evolution of species a plan that glorifies spiritual attainment. It is easy to go a step further and suppose that God is directly at work in the evolutionary process.

Naturalism
Pérez Galdós illustrates one of the adjustments to science taking place in the general culture and literature of the 19th century. A very different literary response to scientific developments is to be found in naturalism, a movement marked by pessimism. To understand its development, one needs to consider the broad philosophical shifts occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The Deism of Descartes and Newton had shaped the 18th century's optimistic, orderly worldview, which neatly separated God and nature. Human beings and all other species were thought of as separate creations that had specially assigned places in a grand scheme; each was systematically classifiable and each conformed to an established pattern. A divine being, although in control of creation, stood apart from it. As a result, science and religion (or materialism and spiritualism) were not in conflict. It was possible to believe in determinism and free will at the same time. This worldview was dominant in Europe, especially in England, and persisted well into the 19th century, finding expression in several novels by Charles Dickens and in the work of the Spanish writer José María de Pereda, to mention just two examples. But then Western thought shifted from a dualistic view of the world to a unitary concept of being. Newtonian and Cartesian dualism was slowly abandoned in favor of a philosophical monism that discarded religion as a valid consideration in the attempt to reach an understanding of nature. This monism ushered in the age of the naturalistic novel, colored in large measure by advances in the biological sciences.

Naturalism asserted itself in Europe late in the 19th century and was characterized by a strong leaning toward science, conceived in opposition to religion. The life sciences, particularly evolutionary theory, had a shaping influence on naturalism, which abandoned belief in the separate creation and fixity of species. Rather, species were seen as completely overshadowing and determining the individual. All things and people were thought to obey an irrational force, or will. Among novelists, the Frenchman Émile Zola is most closely associated with naturalism. In his essay Le Roman expérimental (1880; The Experimental Novel), Zola argued that the modern novel should be experimental in the scientific sense of the word and follow scientific method. Given the dominant role accorded to science, some would say that Zola proposed that novelists write sociological or physiological treatises rather than literary works. His own novel Germinal (1885), although it goes beyond such a narrow framework, is indeed a socioeconomic study of the wretchedness and injustice suffered by the working class. It also analyzes the way human beings relate to the forces of nature and focuses on the question of the individual, as opposed to the human species as a collective entity. Zola's conception of heredity led him to view man as primarily a member of the species, entirely determined by external influences. At the time, heredity was conceived without the benefit of genetics to explain the mechanism by which traits are passed from one generation to the next. It was thought that all kinds of traits were heritable, including characteristics acquired during the lifetime of an individual organism, which do not in fact “enter” the genetic code. This faulty understanding of heritability contributed to an extreme determinism in naturalistic fiction, virtually excluding the possibility of individual freedom. Both plotting and characterization bear the stamp of this determinism in the work of Zola and other naturalist writers, and characters are often conceived primarily as the expression of the natural forces of heredity, environment, and sex.

In Italy, naturalism was known as “verismo,” its paradigmatic examples being La Lupa (1912; The She-Wolf) and I Malavoglia (1881; The House by the Medlar Tree) by Giovanni Verga. In England, George Eliot's novel Middlemarch (1872) is sometimes considered a forerunner of naturalism, with its frequent allusions to the exact sciences and its tendency toward determinism in characterization. Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891) also shares Darwin's view of a biologically active universe, although Hardy's novel is deliberately anthropocentric. The Anglo-Irish novelist George Moore is commonly considered the most important representative of naturalism in English fiction, particularly in his novel Esther Waters (1894). In Spain, Zola's influence is best seen in the novelists Emilia Pardo Bazán and Leopoldo Alas (who wrote under the name Clarín) in the 1880s and Vicente Blasco Ibáñez in the next decade. Pardo Bazán did not in fact approve of Zola's proposal to use the novel as an instrument of science and, as an orthodox Catholic, opposed the philosophical implications of his view of life. Nevertheless, she was attracted to the French writer's concepts and adopted naturalism for what she claimed to be purely formal purposes. Her most naturalistic novels are Los pazos de Ulloa (1886; The House of Ulloa) and its sequel, La madre naturaleza (1887; Mother Nature). A unifying theme is the representation of nature as a powerful force that takes its toll on human beings, who are, in turn, portrayed as opposing forces rather than as individuals. Blasco Ibáñez's best known naturalistic novel is perhaps Cañas y barro (1902; Reeds and Mud), whereas Leopoldo Alas' masterpiece is La Regenta (1884; La Regenta), a novel often compared to Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1857) because both novels focus on the weight of the material world and the failure of love as a means of liberation. Such novels give an indication of the bleak pessimism that marks most naturalistic fiction. Naturalism may have embraced scientific theory, but it found little hope or promise of social improvement in its own scientific worldview.

Science Fiction
A more hopeful response to science is to be found in the work of Jules Verne, who is often seen as the father of science fiction and whose name is synonymous with enthusiasm for scientific progress. Exhibiting an interest primarily in technology, Verne's writings popularized scientific advances of the 19th century and fueled speculation about the future possibilities of science: travel around the world in 80 days, flight, deep-sea exploration, travel to the moon, and so on. Seeing their world changed out of all recognition by the steam-engine, the mechanized factory, the use of gas and electricity, Verne and other 19th-century enthusiasts of science became fascinated by machines and gadgets, and they saw in technology a promise of universal health and happiness. Verne's novels that express this infatuation with science and technology most clearly are Voyage au centre de la terre (1864; A Journey to the Center of the Earth), De la terre à la lune (1865; From the Earth to the Moon), and Vingt mille lieues sous les mers (1870; 20,000 Leagues under the Sea). He treated the novel primarily as a vehicle of information, a form not far removed from scientific journalism. This conception of the novel survives in modified form in contemporary science-fiction writing.

Verne's enthusiasm for technological innovation is by no means an invariable characteristic of science fiction. In fact, another formative influence on the genre was the work of H.G. Wells, whose novels moulded the frightening dystopias of 20th-century science fiction. Wells used Darwin's theory of evolution extensively in his writings, bringing together sociology and biology. His novel The Time Machine (1895), for example, describes a journey through the various stages of human evolution. But Wells did not consider science to be, on the whole, a positive force, as becomes clear in The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), which tells the story of a visionary but misguided scientist who attempts to turn beasts into men. Although science started as a liberation from religious dogma, this novel suggests, it has become an uncontrollable power, incapable of governing itself. Wells' later novels continue this pessimistic attitude about the use of science and set the tone for most science-fiction works of the 20th century. Dystopian novels like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) are cases in point, presenting a totalitarian future made possible by technology.

The 20th Century
The 20th century starts with two major scientific upheavals that had far-reaching effects on Western culture and on the novel: Albert Einstein's theory of relativity and Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theories. The universe, ever since Einstein, has been conceived as unstable, variable, a product of chance, all its points of reference equally valid. Time and space are conceived as continuous entities. Modern physics encourages the imagination to construct new concepts of reality that violate commonsense expectations. With the undermining of time and space as absolutes in themselves, it is no longer appropriate to think of objects as inhabiting concrete, localized space. Time, space, and the objects that exist within them are merged, and we are forced to depend heavily upon abstract mental constructions in our search for new meanings.

Physics has had an enormous impact on literature in the 20th century, primarily in relation to the concept of individual freedom. Whereas 19th-century science led to an understanding of the ways that heredity and environment constrain individual freedom, the new science has given us a more open universe, in which humans may feel more free. However, the vastness of available choices and the perceived randomness of events intrudes on any feeling of liberation.

While physics caused a transformation in the prevailing image of the universe, Freud changed the vision humans had of themselves by bringing sexuality, the unconscious, and irrationality to the foreground. Old models of human behavior and motivation, intimately related to traditional Judeo-Christian morality with its focus on sin, started to disintegrate.

The loss of faith in reason and religion, the suggestion that caprice is a major factor in nature, and Freud's theories concerning dreams and sexuality have all left their mark on the imaginations of 20th-century writers. The association of absurdity with the concept of divinity is evident in French existentialism. Jean-Paul Sartre suggests in his novel La Nausée (1938; Nausea) that a recognition of the fundamental conditions of human existence is liable to induce an insuperable alienation and repugnance to life. Many novels published in Spain after the Civil War (1936-39) replace God with a capricious will that governs the universe, and this also produces a pervasive sense of alienation. For example, Ramón J. Sender's El lugar del hombre (1939; The Place of Man) focuses on the question of freedom in a nonrational universe. El túnel (1948; The Tunnel) by the Argentine physicist-turned-novelist Ernesto Sábato is a perfect example of the 20th-century novel of alienation, as is Albert Camus' L'É tranger (1942; The Stranger).

Another response to modern scientific theory has been a progressively deepening doubt of the effectiveness, even attainability, of objectivity. The primary expression of this doubt in literature is to be found in modernist techniques that discarded omniscient narrators and their claims of being privy to the truth. In modernist fiction, truth became relative and began to multiply with the focus on subjective experience and the use of interior monologue. The most prominent examples include the novels of Virginia Woolf (especially Jacob's Room, 1922; Mrs. Dalloway, 1925; To the Lighthouse, 1927; The Waves, 1931), James Joyce (Ulysses, 1922), William Faulkner (As I Lay Dying, 1930; Absalom, Absalom!, 1936), and André Gide (Les Faux-monnayeurs, 1926; The Counterfeiters).

Postmodernist fiction has continued this trend by progressively undermining the certainties of form demonstrated by the realistic novel. Jorge Luis Borges' stories freely mix the realistic and fantastic. John Fowles' The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969) provides a set of mutually exclusive endings, which takes away the univocality and the false security of closure. Rayuela (1963; Hopscotch) by the Argentine Julio Cortázar, invites the reader to create the story by reading the chapters in whatever order seems appropriate. William Gaddis' The Recognitions (1955), focusing on a painter who forges the “lost works” of early Flemish masters, gradually undermines the distinctions between the genuine and the fake, between authenticity and imposture, between reality and illusion. Other novelists who reflect on the implications of ideas from the new physics in their novels include John Barth with Giles Goat-Boy (1966) and “Lost in the Funhouse” (1968), John Updike with Couples (1968) and Rabbit Redux (1971) and Kurt Vonnegut, with Slaughterhouse-Five (1969) and Breakfast of Champions (1973).

The Information Age
Other novelists have focused specifically on information technology. John Dos Passos' trilogy U.S.A. (1930-36), considered the first fiction of the information age, shows how the mass media rewrite American culture every day. In these three novels, the writer is compared to the scientist in that both produce knowledge and interpretations of reality that are ultimately commodified by the mass media.

In recent decades, the novel has also embraced cybernetics, the formal study of systems in machines and animals, which has been at the core of the computer revolution during the postwar era. Terms we now use to express ourselves in our daily lives such as positive and negative feedback, entropy, information, noise, and sender-receiver all have their origins in or have been inflected by cybernetics. Cybernetics suggests that everything in the knowable universe can be modeled in a logico-mathematical system of quantifiable information. The idea is controversial, since it implies that the richness of the human spirit, human spontaneity, and human inspiration are just the product of mechanical processes that can be imitated and even surpassed by cybernetic mechanisms. Nevertheless, both the sciences and the arts often describe human behaviors in mechanical terms and share the fundamental idea that humans are machines.

Contemporary literature has confronted the central question of cybernetics both as a subject matter and by dramatizing the problem. Computers and robots, cyborgs and androids have proliferated especially in science-fiction works, but the question has also been tackled in other genres. Although cybernetic fiction has been written in different countries (Italo Calvino's Ti con zero [1967; T Zero] is perhaps the best known novel focusing on cybernetics), American authors, most of them male, have probed the issues raised by cybernetics most searchingly. Most famously, Thomas Pynchon's novels V. (1963), The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), and Gravity's Rainbow (1973) have all shown a direct engagement with the science of cybernetics. Other examples include Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano (1952); William Burroughs' fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, such as The Soft Machine (1961) and The Ticket That Exploded (1962); John Barth's Giles Goat-Boy and Letters (1979); Joseph McElroy's Lookout Cartridge (1974) and Plus (1977); Marianne Hauser's The Talking Room (1976); and Don DeLillo's White Noise (1985). Most recently, the subject has produced a movement in science fiction called “cyberpunk,” which is usually traced to William Gibson's novel Neuromancer (1984), still the classic cyberpunk text.

For the 20th-century novelist, science may be feared or embraced, but it cannot be ignored. The characters in contemporary novels cannot be presented simply as the product of heredity and environment anymore, for the individual psyche is perceived as far more problematic, its responses less dependent on specific stimuli, its actions far more random. The 19th-century novel reflects an effort to shift from a dualistic to a unitary worldview spurred on primarily by the theory of biological evolution. The 20th century has inherited that same problem and acquires in addition the burden of having to accommodate itself to the implications of relativity, psychoanalysis, and, most recently, cybernetics.",,2137899001,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Rijsberman, Marijke;Gavilán, Yolanda Molina", Copyright © 1998 Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers., Encyclopedia Entry,, English, English, London,1998,Encyclopedia of the Novel (2 Volumes),,1998,http://silk.library.umass.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/encyclopedias-reference-works/science-novel/docview/2137899001/se-2?accountid=14572," Science And The Novel , Nature , Religion , Naturalism , 18th century , Science , Determinism , 19th century , Scientific method , Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft (1797-1851) , Dickens, Charles (1812-1870) , Verne, Jules (1828-1905) , Hardy, Thomas (1840-1928) , Flaubert, Gustave (1821-1880)"," Darwin, Charles, 1809-1882 , Delillo, Don , Gibson, William, 1948- , Pynchon, Thomas, 1937- , Snow, C.

Science Fiction,"Science fiction, a term popularised in the 1940s, has come to refer to a form of *genre fiction characterised by the narration of imaginative and speculative alternative worlds. Though typically set in the future or in space, sf (usually abbreviated in lower case) also encompasses narratives of *counterfactual history, *virtuality, and an extreme *defamiliarisation of contemporary society. The defamiliarising technique has been seen as central to the sf blend of rationalised plausibility with startling innovation, which Suvin (1979) termed 'cognitive estrangement'.

Largely a twentieth-century and current genre, sf has its roots in the mass literacy, industrialisation, urbanisation, and scientism of nineteenth-century Europe. Some (Aldiss and Wingrove 1986) have dated the *Gothic novel - in particular Frankenstein (1818) - as the precursor of sf, with further parentage claimed for *utopian and *didactic fiction. The genre developed as a *short story or serialised narrative form in France (Jules Verne) and Britain (H. G. Wells), and became massively popularised by the 'pulp' magazines in the eastern U.S. in the 1920s and 1930s (see SERIAL FORM). Sf has since become one of the most widely read and global forms of genre fiction, and has expanded into cinema and TV, as well as informing semi-narrative forms such as computer-supported action games, and influencing art and architecture, design, public ethics debates, and governmental social policy (see COMPUTER GAMES AND NARRATIVE; FILM NARRATIVE; TELEVISION).

Sf writing in the so-called 'golden age' of the 1940s and 1950s tended to emphasise technological progress and was generally positive about innovations and social change. The values conveyed emblematically, thematically, or directly out of the mouths of *characters were either liberal and progressive or, by contrast, focused on an extreme libertarianism and the freedom of the individual. Later social sf tends to be darker, moving into *dystopian visions and the nightmarish landscapes of inner space. The genre has generated a multiplicity of sub-genres and movements, ranging from the outer space and physics of 'hard sf' to the 'New Wave' of stylistically experimental narratives; from the *cyberpunk adventures in techno-capitalism of computer junkies to the feminist dystopias satirising gender oppression (see GENDER STUDIES); from the 'splatter fiction' narratives of film to more cerebral social and political allegories; from the galactic sweep of 'space opera' to exercises in philosophical 'speculative cosmology' (see PHILOSOPHY AND NARRATIVE).

Throughout its history, sf has retained a sense that the short story format is its prototypical essence. Even novelised sf narratives exhibit short story features and organisation (see NOVEL, THE). Science fictional *plots tend to centre on problem-resolution patterns, manifested in a similar way as *detective fiction (alongside which the genre developed) and action *thrillers. Characterisation tends not to follow the psychologised pattern of post-Romantic narratives; instead, characters tend to be ciphers or types, more similar to the tokens of medieval *romance and *allegory (H. G. Wells referred to his own work as 'scientific romance'). Technological and social innovations form the rich background to the imagined world, and it is often one of these aspects or gadgets that operates as a mechanical plot device to engineer a climactic, explosive, or revelatory ending.

In the second half of the twentieth century, a kind of feedback loop emerged in which some sf narratives became more cinematic in *perspective and pacing, and more experimental writing developed in imitation not of *modernist or *postmodernist literature but of movie techniques. At the same time, non-sf fiction writers were more likely to draw on sf features (as in postmodernist and *magical realist narratives), and sf narratives began to demonstrate a more self-reflexive and allusive style in relation to the sf tradition. A sudden popularity of Mars novels just prior to the millennium, for example, looked back to early sf with an elegiac blend of nostalgia and retro-futurism.

Sf in general derives its narrative progression from its manifestly rationalist and progressive *ideology. Even in narratives where technological mishap threatens extinction or destruction, the solution is always sought and usually found in scientific knowledge and reasoning. The scientific technique of observation and deduction places scientists, action-men, idiosyncratic mavericks, or those with special telepathic abilities in the roles of dynamic protagonists. Expert knowledge or adaptable skills in the alternate fictionalised society are the key values for the sf *hero, who must overcome some adversarial, social, or alien conundrum in order to reach a resolution. Sf narratives have a strong sense of an ending (often apocalyptically, or by narrowly averting catastrophe), even if, occasionally, climaxes gesture towards an ineffable mysticism. Such gestures toward the transcendental are not anti-rationalist or supernatural, however, but constitute a technique in sf for illustrating how incredibly advanced the portrayed technology is from the perspective of the contemporary reader.

This blend of rationalism and transcendentalism manifests itself in a concern for explanatory (pseudo-)scientific plausibility. Innovations are almost always made plausible by narratorial or character explanation (see NARRATION; NARRATIVE EXPLANATION), or by a demonstration of the working mechanism to the reader (Stockwell 2000). This *realism in *narrative technique is what distinguishes sf from *fantasy (Roberts 2000). At the same time, sf has been claimed as a symbolist mode (Delany 1977), in the sense that it represents our world in alternate form, rather than reproducing it directly. Corresponding with the sf blend of scientific rationalism and literary artifice, we could say that sf is symbolist in function but realist in technique.",,2137931311,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Stockwell, Peter", © 2005 Routledge Ltd, Encyclopedia Entry,, English, English, London,2010,Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory,,2010,http://silk.library.umass.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/encyclopedias-reference-works/science-fiction/docview/2137931311/se-2?accountid=14572," Science Fiction , History , Genre , Technological change , Postmodernism , Fiction , Motion pictures , Novels , Rationalism , Narratives , Science fiction & fantasy , Wells, H G (1866-1946)",,https://resolver.ebscohost.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Alionrefworks&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.jtitle=&amp;rft.atitle=&amp;rft.au=Stockwell%2C+Peter&amp;rft.aulast=Stockwell&amp;rft.aufirst=Peter&amp;rft.date=2010-01-01&amp;rft.volume=&amp;rft.issue=&amp;rft.spage=&amp;rft.isbn=&amp;rft.btitle=Science+Fiction&amp;rft.title=Science+Fiction&amp;rft.issn=&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Literature Online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Science Fiction and Fantasy (India),"Mystery writer Edmund Crispin defined science fiction as literature that 'presupposes a technology or an effect of technology, or a disturbance in the natural order, such as humanity, up to the time of writing, has not in actual fact experienced'. By these criteria, the seeds of science fiction are present in traditional Indian story-telling, although they have not borne fruit so far. The Indian epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the Puranas (Sanskrit sacred poems of Hindu mythology) and Indian folk literature contain many elements of modern science fiction. They describe flying machines and aerial combat, bombardment of armies from the air, missiles programmed to hit a specified target, and anti-missile missiles, all of which could fit into a futuristic arsenal. They imagine time travel and the concept of parallel worlds with different time frames. One of the Puranas describes Revati and her father travelling to the world of Brahma, where every second is the equivalent of 50,000 earthly years. People travel through space at the speed of thought, faster than light. Some Indian languages, such as Bengali, have a tradition of science fiction, beginning with Jagdish Chandra Bose, the eminent scientist, early in the twentieth century. In English, however, there are only Jayant V. Narlikar (The Return of Vaman, 1989, and The Message from Aristarchus, 1991) and Boman Desai, who employs a science-fiction device - a 'memoscan' (a machine that can replay any part of a subject's memory) - to organize the structure of his first novel, The Memory of Elephants (1988).

A number of science-fiction novels have appeared in the last decade. The Calcutta Chromosome: A Novel of Fevers, Delirium and Discovery (1995) by Amitav Ghosh won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1997 as the best novel in this genre. It combines elements of science fiction and medical history to create a narrative which is partly a detective story and partly a tale of the supernatural. The novel operates in three time-frames from different centuries. It begins with Antar, an Egyptian in New York in the middle of the twenty-first century, searching for Murugan, a colleague who suddenly disappears in Calcutta on 21 August 1995. Murugan is investigating Ronald Ross's discovery of the malarial parasite in 1895, because he has heard that Ross had been pushed along certain paths to facilitate his research.

Two novels by women writers present dystopias. In Suniti Namjoshi's The Mothers of Maya Diip (1989) Jyanvi and the Blue Donkey (who appeared in her earlier book, The Blue Donkey Fables, 1988) are invited to the Indian kingdom of Maya Diip ('The Island of Illusion') . Here they find a rigid matriarchy. All boys are drowned in the sea when they attain puberty, after being milked for sperm. Namjoshi's later work is in the fabular mode; in St. Suniti and the Dragon (1994) the imagery ranges from talking flowers to instructive angels, from Grendel's mother (Beowulf) to St Sebastian. Anuradha Marwah-Roy's Idol Love (1999) presents a chilling picture of India in the twenty-first century. Society in 'Raminland' follows a rigid caste system, and the lower classes ('Dasas' - slaves - and religious minorities called 'Drohis' - traitors) have to obtain special passes when they enter the capital Rajdhani (Delhi) to undertake all the menial work.

Another novel set in the future is Ruchir Joshi's The Last Jet-Engine Laugh (2001). It covers three generations of an Indian family - the novel starts with the narrator's father during the freedom struggle in the 1930s, and ends with a war in 2030, in which his daughter is the leader of an élite squadron of spacecraft attacking Pakistani targets. In the twenty-first century, there are riots for water; it is in such short supply that people resort to 'water tablets' to prevent dehydration. Defecation and personal hygiene become hi-tech operations.",,2137915568,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Narayan, Shyamala A."," Selection, editorial matter and their own contributions © Eugene Benson and L W Conolly 1994, 2005.

utopia,"An imagined form of ideal or superior (usually communistic) human society; or a written work of fiction or philosophical speculation describing such a society. Utopias may be distinguished from mythological Golden Ages or religious paradises in that they are the products of human (i.e. political) arrangement for human benefit. The word was coined by Sir Thomas More in his Latin work Utopia (1516), as a pun on two Greek words, eutopos ('good place') and outopos ('no place'). More's account of an ideal commonwealth was followed by several others including Francis Bacon's New Atlantis (1627); later examples include Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1888), and William Morris's dream vision of socialism in News from Nowhere (1890). Utopian fiction has often been used as the basis of satire on contemporary life, as in Samuel Butler's Erewhon (1872); it is also closely related to some kinds of science fiction. For the inverted or undesirable equivalent of a utopia, the term dystopia is often used, as it is for works describing such a 'bad place'.",,2137936444,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Baldick, Chris"," Copyright © Chris Baldick 2001, 2004, 2008.

Utopian and Dystopian Fiction,"Utopian thought attempts to envision a society in which the various social, political, and economic ills of the real world have been solved, leaving an ideal realm of justice and tranquillity. All *fiction, by projecting a world that is different from the real, physical one, has a potential utopian component. Indeed, the attempt to imagine a world better than our own has long been recognised as one of the crucial functions of all literature. Thus, Sir Philip Sidney, in his Defence of Poetry (1579- 1580), argues that imaginative writing is superior to history and other forms of non-fiction because the natural world is 'brazen', while 'the poets only deliver a golden'. Nevertheless, some works of literature are more specifically dedicated to the projection of utopian visions than are others. There is, in fact, an entire tradition of utopian fiction that attempts to envision ideal societies, generally far removed from the *author's world either temporally or geographically. Meanwhile, beginning especially in the twentieth century, this tradition has given rise to a dystopian counter- tradition that tends to be highly sceptical of utopian visions.

The tradition of utopian fiction dates back at least as far as the ancient Greeks, who produced a number of utopian works, the most important of which is Plato's Republic (380-370 BC), especially in terms of its influence on later utopian writers. The most fundamental political principle of Plato's ideal republic is that it is ruled by an enlightened elite of specially trained, philosophically minded thinkers, known as the Guardians. This elitism, of course, would be abhorrent to many in the modern world, as is Plato's tendency to argue that individual freedom should be sacrificed in the interest of greater happiness for all. This early work thus already indicates the potentially problematic nature of all programmatic utopian visions.

The next major contribution to the tradition of utopian fiction was Sir Thomas More's Utopia (1516), the book that gave the tradition its name. More's utopia is more concrete than Plato's in that his ideal society is located in an actual physical setting (an island off the coast of South America), even though the Greek word utopia literally means 'no place'. More, by describing the visit of a European (Raphael Hythloday) to the island, also gives his work a more narrative bent than Plato's, helping to establish a generic model for future writers of utopian fiction (see GENRE THEORY IN NARRATIVE STUDIES). More's book also makes clear the important satirical component that resides in almost all utopian fiction in that his ideal society is quite specifically set against his own present-day England as a way of criticising the ills of that real-world society (see SATIRIC NARRATIVE).

Other utopian works, such as Tommaso Campanella's The City of the Sun (1602-1623) and Francis Bacon's New Atlantis (1627) followed soon after More's, but the tradition of utopian fiction received a special boost from the Eighteenth-century onward, when humanist faith in the potential of *science and of human beings in general led to a widespread growth in notions that an ideal society, based on the principles of the Enlightenment, could literally be established. These more modern utopian visions culminated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a spate of utopian fictions, often inspired by socialist ideals, appeared. These centrally included Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1888), William Morris's News From Nowhere (1890), and H. G. Wells's A Modern Utopia (1905).

Utopian fictions continued to appear throughout the twentieth century, though these more modern fictions were often informed by a complexity and scepticism that tended to make the line between utopia and dystopia rather unclear, though the thin line between utopia and dystopia had already been emphasised in earlier works such as Book IV of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726). Thus, a crucial modern 'utopian' fiction such as B. F. Skinner's Walden Two (1948), clearly intended as a serious exploration of the possibilities of behavioural psychology to produce citizens suited for life in an idealised society, strikes many as a nightmare vision of brainwashing and social control. Some modern works, such as Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time (1976), include both utopian and dystopian visions of the future, though others, such as Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia and Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed (1974), have attempted more legitimately utopian visions, often inspired by the ideals of the oppositional political movements of the 1960s. In addition, twentieth-century thinkers such as Ernst Bloch continued to explore the potential of utopian thought and to emphasise the utopian potential of fiction and other cultural products.

Still, imaginative visions of ideal societies in the twentieth century took a general turn toward the dystopian and toward a suspicion that, if 'ideal' societies could be established at all, this establishment would lead to stagnation, tyranny, and the suppression of dissent. The tradition of dystopian fiction remains dominated by three founding texts that have helped to set the standards for all other dystopian works. These include Yevgeny Zamyatin's We (1924), Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932), and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). Zamyatin's book is concerned with the dystopian potential of Soviet socialist utopianism, Huxley's with the dystopian potential of capitalist consumerism, and Orwell's with the potential for totalitarian oppression that he finds in both communism and capitalism. Subsequent dystopian works were often specifically aimed either at communism or capitalism, though Western imaginative fiction in particular tended to take a general dystopian turn in the second half of the twentieth century, perhaps due to a diminished utopian imagination that some critics have associated with the era of postmodernism (see POSTMODERN NARRATIVE). For example, the *cyber-punk science fiction of writers such as William Gibson tends to see a relatively bleak future, in comparison with the utopian visions and technological optimism that had informed many earlier works of science fiction.",,2137932120,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Booker, M.

UTOPIAN AND DYSTOPIAN NOVEL,"[DYSTOPIAN NOVEL]

Utopian fiction takes its name from the book Utopia (1516) by Sir Thomas More. The title of More's work is derived from two Greek words, outopia (no place) and eutopia (good place). It describes the imaginary voyage of Raphael Hythlodaeus to a distant island in the newly discovered Americas. More ingeniously mixes fantasy and fact and has kept readers guessing what his motives were in writing the book. Some claim that there are enough signs in the work to indicate that More intended his audience to take Utopian society seriously as a superior vision of how Western society should be organized. The most famous critic to argue this case is the Austrian Marxist Karl Kautsky in Thomas More and His Utopia (1888). Some have alleged that More is tempting his audience with a vision of a false, rational society that has to be rejected because the pagan Utopians lack the true knowledge brought by Christian revelation. Others have read Utopia as a test that requires the reader to decide exactly when the Utopians should be admired and when they should be condemned. Related to this debate is the question of whether the text is meant to be taken seriously at all, or whether it is a humorous game inspired by the works of More's favorite writer, Lucian (C. A.D. 115-200).

More divides his work into two books. The first is a dialogue in which the traveler, Raphael, is introduced to a learned company, among whom is a fictionalized version of More himself. The participants discuss the merits of a society that has managed to dispense with property. In the second book, which has had a far greater impact on subsequent writing, Raphael describes what he saw during his time with the Utopians. The Utopians live an ascetic life that allows little time for frivolity: they all wear the same clothes, change houses every 10 years, study edifying literature in their hours of leisure, and are never idle. They laugh at European greed and are bemused at the value placed upon gold. In philosophy, they are Epicurians, believing that life should be based upon the rational pursuit of pleasure, as defined by the state. When they learn of Christianity, many are converted, as they are convinced of its superiority to their own beliefs. Their punishments for wrongdoing, especially sexual, are harsh, but so pleasant is Utopia deemed by those who have visited it that they invariably prefer a life of slavery there to freedom in their native lands. Despite Raphael's praise of Utopia and his plans to return, the book ends with the fictional More condemning the country as ridiculous because the communistic social system of the Utopians would undermine European greatness.

Utopia, an important work of humanist thought by a learned scholar with a sophisticated knowledge of Greek and Latin writings, is as much a work of political theory as it is fiction. More's text owes much to the discussion of the ideal commonwealth in Plato's Republic and of the lost continent of Atlantis in Timaeus and aligns itself with the philosophical tradition. Nevertheless, More's use of a fictional narrative has given impetus to an openended genre of writing that presents an alternative world to the reader and leaves open the question of its significance, political or otherwise. Utopian fiction is usually assumed to present a world that is more or less good, even though it is by no means clear whether that is the case in Utopia. Its opposite, dystopian fiction, presents a dark vision of an evil world. Just as these two types of writing are not easy to separate, neither is utopian or dystopian fiction always easy to distinguish from other related genres, notably satirical representations of fictional lands (such as Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels [1726], science fiction, or pastoral literature. One should also note the tradition of political thought enshrined in such popular literary visions as the land of Cockaigne, a recent form of which can be found in the song, “The Big Rock Candy Mountain.” In the land of Cockaigne nobody is forced to labor and all food and drink is free, to the extent that roast pigs run around with carving knives in their sides demanding to be eaten (see Morton, 1952).

In general, utopian fiction and utopian thought perform three interrelated functions. Some works make political recommendations by constructing an ideal republic, usually without explaining how such a state actually developed. Tommaso Campanella's La città del sole (written in 1602; The City of the Sun) is an example. Others show what the consequences of implementing a political ideal would be, often with the purpose of exposing the ideology behind such an ideal as dangerous and harmful (as in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, 1932). Finally, utopian works often use a supposedly ideal republic to reflect on existing forms of government, Utopia itself being an instance as well as most forms of feminist utopian fiction.

A significant response was made to More's Utopia by Sir Francis Bacon in The New Atlantis (1626). Bacon's text is much more scientific in focus, and the tour of the island granted the travelers by the mysterious Jew, Joabin, provides a vehicle for Bacon's own predictions of future inventions, illustrating the close connection between utopias and science fiction. Responding to the earlier work, Bacon proposes an interesting correction to the marriage practices described in Utopia. In that work, cou ples were permitted to see each other naked before they agreed to marry. Joabin reports that this practice is regarded as cruel and that rejections after such familiarity are highly embarrassing. Instead, the inhabitants of the New Atlantis have Adam and Eve's pools where friends of the man and woman can see the prospective spouses without clothes and report back on any defects.

Much early European utopian fiction is related to religion in a more direct way, many works being expressions of apocalyptic or millenarian hopes and visions. Johann Eberlin von Gunzburg wrote Wolfaria (1521) after he became a follower of Luther. The text consists of a series of laws and statutes introduced by an imaginary state that suffers from the same evils as Gunzburg's Germany, including the excessive power of monks and priests, the impossibility of marriage for ministers of the Gospel, excessive rites and sacraments that obscure the message of the Gospels, and too many holidays. Wolfaria is a work of revolutionary zeal, but it also contains many sensible recommendations concerning the duties of the state toward its citizens with respect to education, health, and general welfare.

Ludovico Agonistini is usually credited as the writer of the first Counter-Reformation utopia. Sections from his dialogues, L'infinito (1585-90), are often collected as “Repubblica Immaginaria ” by modern scholars. The ideal state that emerges from these writings represents a religious ideal based on an ascetic lifestyle. Between these two extreme is the state described in the anonymous Histoire du grand et Admirable Royaume d'Antangil, published in France in 1616. This work describes an imaginary voyage to the kingdom of Antangil supposedly near Java, where the traveler encounters a society based on a series of rigid hierarchies. Classes are separated rather than abolished, and the austerity of More's Utopia (which the author had read) has given way to splendor and theatrical display. Works by Francesco Patrizi da Cherso, Anton Francesco Doni, Gasparus Stibinus, and Johann Valentin Andreae, all roughly contemporary with Agonistini, illustrate the European scope of the genre, as well as the variety of its manifestations (see Eliav-Feldon, 1982).

Probably the most frequently reproduced early utopian work is Campanella's City of the Sun, cast in the form of a dialogue between a Genoese sea captain who has been to the remote city of the sun and a grand master of the Knights Hospitalers. Campanella was an Italian theologian and poet who spent much of his life in prison for heresy and for his attempts to overthrow Spanish rule in southern Italy and to set up a more equal society. The City of the Sun is based on the principle of love, which abolishes all traces of self-love. Everything comes to be shared equally, including all property and children. Campanella's visionary city has much in common with More's Utopian society, but is less ambiguously presented.

In direct contrast is the work of Joseph Hall, the satirist whose Mundus Alter et Idem (1605; Another World and Yet the Same) has been described as the first dystopian novel. It describes a voyage to the southern hemisphere aboard the ship Fantasy. Here we are introduced to Crapula, the land of inebriate excess, which has two provinces, Pamphagonia (omnivorous gluttony) and Yvronia (drunkenness). Their latitudes and longitudes correspond exactly to those of England and Germany. In the former country (capital, Marzipan), everyone has rotten teeth and halitosis, and citizenship can only be gained by those of spectacular girth. In the latter, every town has a special series of ropes that lead from the market square to each citizen's house, so that returning from parties is less difficult (mistakes still happen, however).

The large number of utopian fictions written during and after the English Civil War of the 1640s resemble those produced after the Reformation in their religious and social hopes and expectations. One of the most important is Samuel Gott's Nova Solyma (1648), which represents an ideal society created after the resettlement of the Jews in a future Jerusalem from which the Turks have been banished. The two protagonists, Politian and Eugenius, gentlemen from Cambridge, catalogue the society they have visited, paying particular attention to the religion observed by the Nova Solymans. Eventually, a commercial treaty is signed between England and Nova Solyma. Gott depicts the islanders' religion as the best to which humans could ever aspire. Although reason has its limits in unlocking the mysteries of God, true happiness and enlightenment will come to whoever renounces sensual pleasures and the lure of romantic love in favor of devotion to Christian principles. Also of significance is John Sadler's Olbia: The New Island Lately Discovered (1660), which is the dialogue of a hermit and a shipwrecked sailor on an isolated island and expounds various theories of numerology and other forms of mysticism at great length. James Harrington's Oceana (1656) is an important work of republican political theory, which argues that private property should be limited rather than abolished. By way of contrast, New Atlantis, Begun by the Lord Verulam, Viscount St. Albans: and Continued by R. H. Esquire, Wherein is set forth a Platform of Monarchical Government (1660), is a robust defense of monarchy and privilege.

These are followed by a spate of utopian novels in the 18th century that are far less optimistic. Joseph Hall's satire may have served as an example for the imaginary lands represented in Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Book III. The Academy of Lagado and its perverse scientific experiments may be an attack on the optimistic visions of inevitable scientific progress contained in Bacon's New Atlantis. The flying island of Laputa, which oppresses the impoverished island of Balnibari, is a clear satire of the English oppression of Ireland. This section of Swift's work may be read as dystopian fiction, as may the first voyage to Lilliput. Both are balanced against the more temperate vision of the second voyage to Brobdignag. Book IV, presenting the encounter between Gulliver and the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos, may be read as either utopian or dystopian, depending on one's interpretation of the ending. Have the Houyhnhnms established an ideal society, or is their faith in their own reason an arrogance that makes them even worse than the violent and fallible societies encountered in the course of Gulliver's earlier travels? In a sense, the question for the reader is the same as the one posed by Utopia, which is why Gulliver's Travels demands to be read within the utopian tradition of fiction.

Similar questions might be asked of Samuel Johnson's The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia (1759), which describes the restless wanderings of the young protagonist when he tires of his idyllic kingdom. Johnson's point would appear to be that there can be no earthly utopia, because man is far too restless ever to be satisfied even with happiness. “The Conclusion, in which nothing is concluded” forces the reader to relate the book to his or her life, a recurring motif of utopian fiction. In general, 18th-century utopian fiction tended to be highly satirical, another notable example being Bernard de Mandeville's Fable of the Bees (1714), which portrays the earth as a giant hive populated with self-interested bees who thrive on greed.

A further development in the history of utopian fiction came with the rise of socialism and communism in the 19th century. The new social beliefs were often implicitly or explicitly utopian, notably those of Robert Owen (1771-1858), Claude-Henri Saint-Simon (1760-1825), and François Fourier (1772-1837). The most celebrated socialist utopia is probably William Morris' News from Nowhere (1890). The author falls asleep in his Hammersmith house and dreams that he has woken up in a communist society in the 21st century. He discovers a nonindustrial rural society where handicrafts are valued and practiced by everyone. (Morris was a craftsman, and it has been rather cruelly remarked that the world imagined in News from Nowhere appears to have been designed by Morris himself.) There is no money, no central government (the Houses of Parliament have become a dung market), no legal structure, and a religion of humanity holds sway. Also important, and partly inspired by Morris, are H. G. Wells' A Modern Utopia (1905) and The New Machiavelli (1911). Wells' science-fiction novella The Time Machine (1895) describes the opposite case, exposing a false pastoral vision of human evolution gone terribly wrong. It depicts a future world that appears idyllic until it is discovered that the beautiful, but rather vacuous, Eloi are in fact at the mercy of the terrifying Morlocks, descendants of underground laborers. A similar theme is explored in E. M. Forster's long short story “The Machine Stops” (1908).

News from Nowhere is an attack on the increasing industrialization of Western society in the 19th century, as well as what the author views as repressive political developments. Many dystopian novels of the 20th century share Morris' concerns, most notably Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). The former novel is set in the year 632 After Ford (the 26th century-time is now dated after the first major producer of the motor car rather than a religious figure), in a world where everything is regulated by the state to the extent that humans are biologically engineered and kept happy and docile by the administration of psychedelic drugs. This dystopia is challenged by the Savage from the American Indian reservations who takes up the ideals of freedom and passion, debating these with the World Controller Mustapha Mond. The novel ends with the Savage's suicide. Orwell's novel is equally bleak; it represents a world where Britain has become a minor part of the superstate Oceania, ruled by a single party and perpetually at war with the other superstates Eurasia and Eastasia. Whereas in Huxley's novel the drug Soma is used to quell any individuality and rebellious spirit, in Orwell's obedience is achieved through the extensive use of propaganda, citizens being encouraged to love Big Brother, whose image is omnipresent. The novel tells the story of Winston Smith, a minor government official who dares to challenge the state by commiting “thought-crimes” and daring to fall in love. Smith is eventually betrayed, broken by his experience in room 101 where he faces his ultimate horror (being eaten by rats), and learns to love Big Brother. Both Huxley and Orwell were influenced by My (written in 1920; We), by the Russian novelist Evgenii Zamiatin (1884-1937), a satire on a future totalitarian state.

Probably the most significant development in the history of utopian/dystopian fiction in recent years has been the rediscovery and revival of a tradition of feminist utopian writing. Works by pioneering feminist writers such as Katherine Philips (1632-64), Jane Barker (1652-c.1727), and Sarah Scott (1723-95) have received renewed attention. As The Feminist Companion to Literature in English (1990) comments, “Utopian fiction is imagined in the face of contemporary social realities: women's peculiar oppression thus became the backdrop for a distinctive series of female utopian visions.” Important recent fiction has attempted to imagine a future feminist world. Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time (1976) tells the story of a Chicana woman imprisoned in a mental hospital who is transported to a future society attempting to abolish sexism, racism, and heterosexism. Ursula Le Guin's The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia (1974) portrays an anarchist moon colony. In a more dystopian vein is her The New Atlantis (1975), which represents a totalitarian United States of the future. Doris Lessing's experimental science-fiction novels Canopus in Argus: Archives (1979-83) and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1985) are similarly dystopian.",,2137921376,Encyclopedias & Reference Works,"Hadfield, Andrew", Copyright © 1998 Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers., Encyclopedia Entry,, English, English, London,1998,Encyclopedia of the Novel (2 Volumes),,1998,http://silk.library.umass.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/encyclopedias-reference-works/utopian-dystopian-novel/docview/2137921376/se-2?accountid=14572," Utopian and Dystopian Novel , Dystopian Novel , Writers , Utopias , Writing , Novels , Books , Society , Science fiction & fantasy , Swift, Jonathan (1667-1745) , More, Thomas (1478-1535) , Huxley, Aldous (1894-1963)"," Acker, Kathy, 1948- , Atwood, Margaret, 1939- , Bacon, Francis, 1561-1626 , Bellamy, Edward, 1850-1898 , Hacker, Marilyn, 1942- , Hall, Joseph, 1574-1656 , Huxley, Aldous, 1894-1963 , More, Thomas, Sir, Saint, 1478-1535 , Morris, William, 1834-1896 , Orwell, George, 1903-1950 , Philips, Katherine, 1631-1664 , 1984 , A Clockwork Orange , Fahrenheit 451 , The Handmaid's Tale",https://resolver.ebscohost.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Alionrefworks&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.jtitle=&amp;rft.atitle=&amp;rft.au=Hadfield%2C+Andrew&amp;rft.aulast=Hadfield&amp;rft.aufirst=Andrew&amp;rft.date=1998-01-01&amp;rft.volume=&amp;rft.issue=&amp;rft.spage=&amp;rft.isbn=&amp;rft.btitle=UTOPIAN+AND+DYSTOPIAN+NOVEL&amp;rft.title=UTOPIAN+AND+DYSTOPIAN+NOVEL&amp;rft.issn=&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Literature Online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
